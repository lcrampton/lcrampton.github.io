		<p>Howdy everybody.  My name is Lucas.  I recently stopped "going home" and started "visiting my parents."  Now i live in the District of Columbia, 
		a second-rate city.  This is where nobody makes anything and everybody gets paid. This is not New York.</p>
		<p>I came here from Allentown, Pennsylvania, first to study, then to find work.  Allentown is a third-tier city.  And as a (commercial) pilot's son, 
		i used to find a little difficulty calling it "home" with a great deal of confidence.  But after twelve years nestled in the Appalachians, 
		it earned the appellation.  After talking down on it for years, i will now defend Allentown earnestly from vebal attack in DC's mean streets.  
		I will shoot down pejoratives with statistical flak, historical gunfire, and anecdotal torpedoes.  Allentown is my family.  Nobody talks to 
		her like that (except me).</p>
		<p>I studied Global Health and Sustainability at the George Washington University.  When i graduated, i lived with my parents for a few months and
		made <a href="https://ifbm.bandcamp.com/album/the-bibimbap-bop">The Bibimbap Bop</a> with Big Bill.  When the energy grew too restless, i packed a
		 couple bags and took a bus back to Washington.  There, i began cooking at a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef.  After six months, i left to 
		 protest the poor and unethical management and switched to a catering start-up.  The restaurant folded ten days later.</p>

		<p>By July of 2018, i felt the need to make moves into the office world of Washington, to continue chasing the dream.  College was my springboard
		to enhance my power to make the world a better place.  The time i spent in kitchens and schlepping food was time i could do little to ameliorate 
		the condition of the world's most vulnerable or to slow anthropogenic climate change.  So now i am...an office temporary!  At least i am on the 
		right ladder, though, even if i remain at the bottom rung.
		<p>My temporary workings bounced me around a few mailing assistant positions downtown before i landed at a long-term (three months) assignment at 
		the National Kidney Foundation serving the National Capital Area.  I am working on organizing their walk and gala events.  Also, they liked my 
		writing enough to let me compose segments for their monthly newsletter.
		<p>I recently visited Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh is a neat city with blue collar vibes and educated energy.  At least several people of whom you have 
		heard have origins in Pittsburgh: Rachel Carson, Andy Warhol, Mister Rogers, Mac Miller.  Consider it the Grand Rapids of Pennsylvania.
