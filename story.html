<h1>The Story So Far</h1>
        
        <img src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/Lucas Pittsburgh Botanical.jpg"

		<p>Howdy everybody.&nbsp  My name is Lucas.&nbsp  I recently stopped "going home" and started "visiting my parents."  Now i live in the District of Columbia.&nbsp  This is where people ostensibly make policy.&nbsp <span id="NY">This is not New York.</span>
		<p>I came here from Allentown, Pennsylvania, first to study, then to find work.&nbsp  Allentown is a third-tier city.&nbsp  And as a (commercial) pilot's son who moved a few times, i used to find a little difficulty calling it "home" with a great deal of confidence.&nbsp  But after twelve years nestled in the Appalachians, it earned the appellation.&nbsp  After talking down on it for years, i will now defend Allentown earnestly from vebal attack in DC's mean streets.&nbsp  I will shoot down pejoratives with statistical flak, historical gunfire, and anecdotal torpedoes.&nbsp  Allentown is my family.&nbsp  Nobody talks to her like that (except me).</p>
		<p>I studied Global Health and Sustainability at the George Washington University.&nbsp  When i graduated, i lived with my parents for a few months and
		made <a href="https://ifbm.bandcamp.com/album/the-bibimbap-bop">The Bibimbap Bop</a> with Big Bill.&nbsp  When the energy grew too restless, i packed a
		couple bags and took a bus back to Washington.&nbsp  There, i began cooking at a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef.&nbsp  After six months, i left to protest the poor and unethical management.&nbsp  The restaurant folded ten days later.&nbsp  I switched to a catering start-up.&nbsp  The work there indulged my work ethic and tested my physical and mental endurance.&nbsp  One of my favorite memories from those days involves loading seventy pound CaterGators up a steep hill into a van in a steady downpour while a rivulet flowed through the holes in my shoes.&nbsp  Some people do this every week for decades.&nbsp  I lasted three and a half months.</p>

		href="http://ifbm.bandcamp.com/album/the-bibimbap-bop">The Bibimbap Bop by Investment Fraud Bingo Monday</a></iframe></div>
		<p>By July of 2018, i felt the need to make moves into the office world of Washington, to continue chasing the dream.&nbsp  College was my springboard
		to enhance my power to make the world a better place.&nbsp  The time i spent in kitchens and schlepping food was time i could do little to ameliorate 
		the condition of the world's most vulnerable or to slow anthropogenic climate change.&nbsp  So i leapt.&nbsp  Without a job lined up, i quit my catering job without any hard feelings.&nbsp  I dusted off the suit and passed out rèsumès.&nbsp  After a few weeks, i became...an office temporary!&nbsp  At least i was on the right ladder, though, even if i remained at the bottom rung.
		<p>My temporary workings bounced me around a few mailing assistant positions downtown before i landed at a long-term (three months) assignment at 
		the National Kidney Foundation serving the National Capital Area.&nbsp  I worked on organizing their walk and gala events.&nbsp  Also, they liked my 
		writing enough to let me compose segments for their monthly newsletter.&nbsp  As my termination date would grow nearer, they would extend my assignment.&nbsp  This continued as they encouraged me to apply to the full-time Community Outreach Coordinator position.
		<p>And that is what i do now!&nbsp  Nearly two years after graduation, i have landed a real job that requires a degree.&nbsp  This walk took a long time—longer than i imagined while sitting in the library or the residence hall.&nbsp  Whoever you are, wherever you are going, keep your eye on the future and never stop pushing.&nbsp  Reflect on your strategy and work cleverly.&nbsp  You are not above anything.&nbsp  Have the patience to let your work speak for itself.&nbsp  There are ten thousand lessons in peeling shrimp.
		
		<h3>Pittsburgh</h3>
		<p>I visited Pittsburgh in October 2018.&nbsp  Pittsburgh is a neat city with blue collar vibes and educated energy.&nbsp  At least several people of whom you have 
		heard have origins in Pittsburgh: Rachel Carson, Andy Warhol, Mister Rogers, Mac Miller.&nbsp  Consider it the Grand Rapids of Pennsylvania.&nbsp  While there, i had the opportunity to go for a couple runs.&nbsp  Always run on vacation; these parts are some of the most memorable—not for being the best parts, but for the brain chemistry.&nbsp  And what a way to explore a place.&nbsp  Anyway, my man VG Money took me around town and showed me the Andy Warhol Museum, the botanical gardens, and some hip spots for pierogies and Izakaya.</p>
		
		<h3>Tenallytown</h3>
		<p>Tenleytown was home for nearly two years.&nbsp  I watched seasons turn around the trees and schools and churches there.&nbsp  The setting sun painted Fort Reno gold, scarlet, and orange.&nbsp  The radio towers always blinked but never flinched.</p>
		<p>I hope never to forget the characters of Tenley:</p>
		<ul><li>Poodle Man</li>
		<li>Matthew Lesko</li>
		<li>Black Man with Pit Bull</li>
		<li>Nanny Wit Da Fanny</li></ul>
		<p>A part of me hopes they will remember me.&nbsp  Or at least think on occasion, "Whatever happened to that handsome runner?"  We are irreversibly tied to the geographic areas we and our forefathers inhabit, and i expect to make returns, both by obligation and accident.</p>
		<p>I lived in Petworth for a spell.  Now i live in Glover Park, which works.&nbsp  
		
		<h3>Africa</h3>
		<p>Let me take us back to Africa for a little while.&nbsp  In 2016, i took a sixteen-hour plane ride to Gaborone, Botswana for a 
		semester abroad.&nbsp  This is something i had really wanted to do, but it is also something we just do.&nbsp  Doubt began swirling even before my plane ride and compounded after i landed.&nbsp  Why was i here?  What was i to do with no language to learn and a bleak semi-arid zone stretched out before me?  I planned a trip east toward Mozambique, hoping that would be the cure, but ten to sixteen men jumped us in Johannesburg.&nbsp  I ended up in a pretty dark place—an angry, despondent, anxious place—for a lot of that trip.&nbsp  Even so, there are few elations like those of ziplining across gorges in Swaziland's Malolotja National Park, or spilling from an eight-hour cramped bus ride onto the pristine white sand of Tofo Beach.&nbsp  Life can be a wild ride sometimes.</p>
		<img src="Github_Images/Red Dunes in Namibia.JPG" align="right" width="400px" alt="Red Dunes in the Sossusvlei">
		<p>Things started clearing up towards the end of my stay, perhaps partly because it was coming to a close.&nbsp  But i also made a ten-day excursion into Namibia, and that was exciting.&nbsp  <!--Donald Trump won the presidency and the motherfucking Republican party took the House and Senate while i was on the Atlantic coast in Swakopmund, which sullied an otherwise rapturous trip.&nbsp  -->Namibia utterly changed me.&nbsp The Earth is a magnificent place.&nbsp  I asked myself if the sky looks bigger in Africa; it is difficult to explain because it is difficult to comprehend.&nbsp  Standing in the Sossusvlei, or sitting six feet from flamingos in Walvis Bay, or watching a thunderstorm tumble over the mountains around Windhoek and overtake you, you cannot shake the sense that this planet will one day rise up around you and swallow whole everything humanity holds dear.&nbsp  The sun beats down.&nbsp  The frigid ocean rolls in and out.&nbsp  The wind blows orange sand across your arms and legs, scrubbing away the old you.</p>
