<h1>The Story So Far</h1>
        
        <img src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/Lucas Pittsburgh Botanical.jpg" 
		width="400px" align="right" alt="Lucas in Pittsburgh, PA.  Vikas Gupta took this picture.">
        
		<p>Howdy everybody.&nbsp  My name is Lucas.&nbsp  I recently stopped "going home" and started "visiting my parents."  Now i live in the District of Columbia.&nbsp  This is where people ostensibly make policy.&nbsp This is Chocolate City, Hollywood for nerds, the smallest big city this side of the Mississippi, where the Mumbo sauce flows freely.&nbsp <span id="NY">This is not New York.</span>
		<p>I came here from Allentown, Pennsylvania, first to study, then to find work.&nbsp  Allentown is a third-tier city.&nbsp  And as a (commercial) pilot's son who moved a few times, i used to find difficulty calling it "home" with a great deal of confidence.&nbsp  But after twelve years nestled in the Appalachians, it earned the appellation.&nbsp  When once i talked down on it, i now defend Allentown earnestly from vebal attack in DC's mean streets.&nbsp  I shoot down pejoratives with statistical flak, historical gunfire, and anecdotal torpedoes.&nbsp  Allentown is my family.&nbsp  Nobody talks to her like that (except me).</p>
		<p>I studied Global Health and Sustainability at the George Washington University.&nbsp  When i graduated, i lived with my parents for a few months and
		made <a href="https://ifbm.bandcamp.com/album/the-bibimbap-bop">The Bibimbap Bop</a> with Big Bill.&nbsp  When the energy grew too restless, i packed a
		couple bags and took a bus back to Washington.&nbsp  There, i began cooking at a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef.&nbsp  After six months, i left to protest the poor and unethical management.&nbsp  The restaurant folded ten days later.&nbsp  I switched to a catering start-up.&nbsp  The work there indulged my work ethic and tested my physical and mental endurance.&nbsp  One of my favorite memories from those days involves loading seventy pound CaterGators up a steep hill into a van in a steady downpour while a rivulet flowed through the holes in my shoes.&nbsp  Some people do this every week for decades.&nbsp  I lasted three and a half months.</p>
		<div class="bc-embed"><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=367508234/size=large/bgcol

		href="http://ifbm.bandcamp.com/album/the-bibimbap-bop">The Bibimbap Bop by Investment Fraud Bingo Monday</a></iframe></div>
		<p>By July of 2018, i felt the need to make moves into the office world of Washington, to continue chasing the dream.&nbsp  College was my springboard
		to enhance my power to make the world a better place.&nbsp  The time i spent in kitchens and schlepping food was time i could do little to ameliorate 
		the condition of the world's most vulnerable or to slow anthropogenic climate change.&nbsp  So i leapt.&nbsp  Without a job lined up, i quit my catering job without any hard feelings.&nbsp  I dusted off the suit and passed out rèsumès.&nbsp  After a few weeks, i became...an office temporary!&nbsp  At least i was on the right ladder, though, even if i remained at the bottom rung.
		<p>My temporary workings bounced me around a few mailing assistant positions downtown before i landed at a long-term (three months) assignment at 
		the National Kidney Foundation serving the National Capital Area.&nbsp  I worked on organizing their walk and gala events.&nbsp  Also, they liked my 
		writing enough to let me compose segments for their monthly newsletter.&nbsp  As my termination date would grow nearer, they would extend my assignment.&nbsp  This continued as they encouraged me to apply to the full-time Community Outreach Coordinator position.
		<p>And that is what i do now!&nbsp  Nearly two years after graduation, i have landed a real job that requires a degree.&nbsp  This walk took a long time—longer than i imagined while sitting in the library or the residence hall.&nbsp  Whoever you are, wherever you are going, keep your eye on the future and never stop pushing.&nbsp  Reflect on your strategy and work cleverly.&nbsp  You are not above anything.&nbsp  Have the patience to let your work speak for itself.&nbsp  There are ten thousand lessons in peeling shrimp.
		
		<h3>Pittsburgh</h3>
		<p>I visited Pittsburgh in October 2018.&nbsp  Pittsburgh is a neat city with blue collar vibes and educated energy.&nbsp  At least several people of whom you have heard have origins in Pittsburgh: Rachel Carson, Andy Warhol, Mister Rogers, Mac Miller.&nbsp  It is also the setting of the 1983 box-office smash <em>Flashdance</em>.&nbsp You might consider it the Grand Rapids of Pennsylvania.&nbsp  While there, i had the opportunity to go for a couple runs.&nbsp  Always run on vacation; these parts are some of the most memorable—not for being the best parts, but for the brain chemistry.&nbsp  And what a way to explore a place.&nbsp  Anyway, my man VG Money took me around town and showed me the Andy Warhol Museum, the botanical gardens, and some hip spots for pierogies and Izakaya.</p>
		
		<h3>Tenallytown</h3>
		<p>Tenleytown was home for nearly two years.&nbsp  I watched seasons turn around the trees and schools and churches there.&nbsp  The setting sun painted Fort Reno gold, scarlet, and orange.&nbsp  The radio towers always blinked but never flinched.</p>
		<p>I hope never to forget the characters of Tenley:</p>
		<ul><li>Poodle Man</li>
		<li>Matthew Lesko</li>
		<li>Black Man with Pit Bull</li>
		<li>Nanny Wit Da Fanny</li></ul>
		<p>A part of me hopes they will remember me.&nbsp  Or at least think on occasion, "Whatever happened to that handsome runner?"  We are irreversibly tied to the geographic areas we and our forefathers inhabit, and i expect to make returns, both by obligation and accident.</p>
		
		<h3>Brightwood</h3>
		<p>I lived in Petworth for a spell.&nbsp Then i lived in Glover Park for a triple spell.&nbsp Now i live in Brightwood, and probably will continue to do so for a sextuple spell.&nbsp Brightwood strikes an eclectic tone, in multiple ways.&nbsp We have a lot of different kinds of architecture and housing here, and for a range of income groups.&nbsp There are low-income apartments on Georgia and Colorado Avenues, mansions on sixteenth street, aging wacky standalones and fresh luxury dwellings in Takoma, and series of duplexii on our cross-streets.&nbsp Black and white, cat and dog rub shoulders.&nbsp We spend so much time looking at our lawns that we forget we live in the shadow of DC's Eiffel Tower.</p>
		
		<h3>Africa</h3>
		<p>Let me take us back to Africa for a little while.&nbsp  In 2016, i took a sixteen-hour plane ride to Gaborone, Botswana for a semester abroad.&nbsp  This is something i had really wanted to do, but it is also something we just do.&nbsp  Doubt began swirling even before my plane ride and compounded after i landed.&nbsp  Why was i here?  What was i to do with no language to learn and a bleak semi-arid zone stretched out before me?&nbsp I planned a trip east toward Mozambique, hoping that would be the cure, but ten to sixteen men jumped us in Johannesburg.&nbsp  I ended up in a pretty dark place—an angry, despondent, anxious place—for a lot of that trip.&nbsp  Even so, there are few elations like those of ziplining across gorges in Swaziland's Malolotja National Park, or spilling from an eight-hour cramped bus ride onto the pristine white sand of Tofo Beach.&nbsp  Life can be a wild ride sometimes.</p>
		<img src="Github_Images/Red Dunes in Namibia.JPG" align="right" width="400px" alt="Red Dunes in the Sossusvlei">
		<p>Things started clearing up towards the end of my stay, perhaps partly because it was coming to a close.&nbsp  But i also made a ten-day excursion into Namibia, and that was exciting.&nbsp  <!--Donald Trump won the presidency and the motherfucking Republican party took the House and Senate while i was on the Atlantic coast in Swakopmund, which sullied an otherwise rapturous trip.&nbsp -->Namibia utterly changed me.&nbsp The Earth is a magnificent place.&nbsp  I asked myself if the sky looks bigger in Africa; it is difficult to explain because it is difficult to comprehend.&nbsp  Standing in the Sossusvlei, or sitting six feet from flamingos in Walvis Bay, or watching a thunderstorm tumble over the mountains around Windhoek and overtake you, you cannot shake the sense that this planet will one day rise up around you and swallow whole everything humanity holds dear.&nbsp  The sun beats down.&nbsp  The frigid ocean rolls in and out.&nbsp  The wind blows orange sand across your arms and legs, scrubbing away the old you.</p>
		
		<h3>Buddhism</h3>
		<p>Eastern philosophy came into my life at a young age via the martial arts.&nbsp My senseis emphasized the ethical and philosophical sides of the martial arts, inspired especially by Bruce Lee.&nbsp It was far from enough to become strong.&nbsp Without direction, you will run all of your strength off the path.&nbsp They did not want a couple hundred Cobra Kai running around testing all of their strikes and holds on other teens and children, because that would create liabilities—and they were not sadists.&nbsp So nearly as often as they instructed us how to quickly break wrists and inflict acute pain, they guided us in group chats toward the modest way of the peaceful warrior and intelligent self-defense.</p>
		<p>It caught on with me, and i read some books.&nbsp It rings true.&nbsp The first noble truth—that life entails suffering, that you will encounter aging, sickness, and death, that <em>shit happens</em>—grows increasingly salient as one enters adulthood, as the twenty-first century world unfolds and unravels.&nbsp Life is going to hit us with many blows; what can we do but take it in stride, cry when we have to, and make it to the other end?</p>
		<p>We will end our lives with nothing, and we can uncover our own liberation if we learn to desire nothing.&nbsp 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Running</h3>
		<p>i ran the Marine Corps Marathon on October 27, 2019.  Through an intermittent deluge, i clocked 3:28:30.  i am not satisfied with this, but i am proud of hitting the pavement and pushing through what i pushed through.</p>
		<p>I began running competitively in eighth grade.&nbsp Here are my personal records:</p>

		<p>On November 21, 2020, i completed the JFK 50-mile.&nbsp It was a long run, but fun.&nbsp The first third takes you up a mountain broadside, which had people walking.&nbsp It tops out five and a half miles in at a radio tower, then continues along the Appalachian Trail as it undulates along the ridgeline.&nbsp So it really busts your quadriceps early.&nbsp On the mountainous terrain, i met the first of the memorable characters who would accompany me that day.&nbsp A runner i came to refer to as "<a href="http://jackquinnsrunners.com/">Jack Quinn</a>" slipped by at one point, and i hitched my fortunes to him, following closely until the aid station at the foot of the trail.&nbsp I passed a man in his fifties or sixties who replied to my "Scootin' by on ya left" with "I am an old man just trying to finish."&nbsp You and me both, sir.</p>
		<p>I want to shout out the spectators and cheerleaders who added their energy whenever they could.&nbsp I began to recognize one lady in black, and she began to recognize me as well; her boo must have been just behind me, but she was notable for waving a buff around, and i began to think of her as my friend.&nbsp Some spectators i only had the pleasure of passing once, including a very big dog at the exit of the Appalachian Trail section.&nbsp I said "Ooh, big dog."&nbsp I must have had a bit of a smile going on, because several people told me about it.&nbsp When pressed at one time, i was able to say, "I am smiling for the puppy!" and pointed to a young golden retriever.&nbsp Around Harper's Ferry, somebody pointed to me and said what sounded like "Nice beer."&nsbp I tried to connect the dots between beer and my Allentown Wounded Warrior 5k shirt for several minutes, then realized that he said "Nice beard."&nbsp Around mile forty-six, four ladies sat on their front porch, watching racers pass.&nbsp One called out to me, "I like your ball-et," presumably a portmanteau of "wallet" and "testicles" referring to my <a href="https://spibelt.com/">SPIbelt</a>.&nbsp Her friend declared "She's single!" and i waved.&nbsp In the final few hundred meters i began to accelerate, finding that i still had some gas in the tank.&nbsp A lady caught up to me, but i poured on more, not allowing her to pull away.&nbsp We sped toward the finish, locked in a matching pace.&nbsp "Come oonnn!" i yelled.&nbsp We crossed simultaneously, and the announcer declared, "Lucas and Aimee, crossing the finish together!"</p>
		<p>I am not sure if there is a runners community the same way there is a bus-driver community or a cyclist community or a DIY community.&nbsp On one hand, they are extremely supportive in these circumstances, volunteering and cheering and checking on people who fall.&nbsp But running can also be highly solitary during training.&nbsp And if you cut someone off, step on heels, or pull some other shenanigans (especially around start and finish lines), you will know someone's wrath.</p>
		<p>I am not in it for the community, so much as the sense of freedom and unparalleled sights.&nbsp At Harper's Ferry, my run coincided with a train crossing the river and bending up north into West Virginia, where country scenes morphed from that historic town with its ramshackle wood rowhomes to people's properties along the river at the termini of dirt roads.&nbsp We heard a dog bark at his human's chainsaw as it swam in the river and he trimmed down a snag.&nbsp We saw barns and boats and nice little sandbars.&nbsp The scarlet leaves of maples along the canal hummed with radiance against seas of decomposing leaves and dark, mossy shale subject to tectonic uplift.&nbsp When i rubbed my eyes after mile twenty-five, my vision got purplish and spotty, so i tried to refrain from that.&nbsp People lose toenails and see things that are not there during ultrathons and long cycling tours.&nbsp I experienced neither, but i did spend a long moment watching a robed skeletal being with a scythe on a rocky bluff resolve into a twisted tree trunk.</p>
		<p>At one middle aid station, a fellow runner requested and received ibuprofen.&nbsp That seemed like cheating to me.&nbsp I thought the point was to compete to push through the pain, to test your mental fortitude?&nbsp If we can use ibuprofen, what else can we bring to improve our race?&nbsp Whiskey?&nsbp Opiates?&nbsp Amphetamines?&nbsp Clearly not, but if these would get asterisked, why not stick an asterisk next to users of ibuprofen?&nbsp Now, ibuprofen is not really <em>cheating</em>.&nbsp Giving and ultimatum to drop out or push through for unanticipated joint and ligament pain could be inordinately cruel and ageist (sexist in the case of menstrual cramps).&nbsp My position, for now, is that is fine, but to those who eschew all painkillers through their ultrathon: an extra cheers to you.</p>
