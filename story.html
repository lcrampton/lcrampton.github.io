		<p>Howdy everybody.  My name is Lucas.  I recently stopped "going home" and started "visiting my parents."  Now i live in the District of Columbia, 
		a second-rate city.  This is where nobody makes anything and everybody gets paid. This is not New York.</p>
		<p>I came here from Allentown, Pennsylvania, first to study, then to find work.  Allentown is a third-tier city.  And as a (commercial) pilot's son, 
		i used to find a little difficulty calling it "home" with a great deal of confidence.  But after twelve years nestled in the Appalachians, 
		it earned the appellation.  After talking down on it for years, i will now defend Allentown earnestly from vebal attack in DC's mean streets.  
		I will shoot down pejoratives with statistical flak, historical gunfire, and anecdotal torpedoes.  Allentown is my family.  Nobody talks to 
		her like that (except me).
