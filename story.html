<h1>The Story So Far</h1>

		<p>Howdy everybody.  My name is Lucas.  I recently stopped "going home" and started "visiting my parents."  Now i live in the District of Columbia, 
		a second-rate city.  This is where nobody makes anything and everybody gets paid. This is not New York.</p>
		<p>I came here from Allentown, Pennsylvania, first to study, then to find work.  Allentown is a third-tier city.  And as a (commercial) pilot's son
		who moved a few times, i used to find a little difficulty calling it "home" with a great deal of confidence.  But after twelve years nestled in
		the Appalachians, it earned the appellation.  After talking down on it for years, i will now defend Allentown earnestly from vebal attack in DC's mean 
		streets.  I will shoot down pejoratives with statistical flak, historical gunfire, and anecdotal torpedoes.  Allentown is my family.  Nobody talks to 
		her like that (except me).</p>
		<p>I studied Global Health and Sustainability at the George Washington University.  When i graduated, i lived with my parents for a few months and
		made <a href="https://ifbm.bandcamp.com/album/the-bibimbap-bop">The Bibimbap Bop</a> with Big Bill.  When the energy grew too restless, i packed a
		 couple bags and took a bus back to Washington.  There, i began cooking at a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef.  After six months, i left to 
		 protest the poor and unethical management and switched to a catering start-up.  The restaurant folded ten days later.</p>

		<p>By July of 2018, i felt the need to make moves into the office world of Washington, to continue chasing the dream.  College was my springboard
		to enhance my power to make the world a better place.  The time i spent in kitchens and schlepping food was time i could do little to ameliorate 
		the condition of the world's most vulnerable or to slow anthropogenic climate change.  So i leapt.  Without a job lined up, i quit my catering job without any hard feelings.  I dusted off the suit and passed out rèsumès.  After a few weeks, i became...an office temporary!  At least i was on the 
		right ladder, though, even if i remained at the bottom rung.
		<p>My temporary workings bounced me around a few mailing assistant positions downtown before i landed at a long-term (three months) assignment at 
		the National Kidney Foundation serving the National Capital Area.  I worked on organizing their walk and gala events.  Also, they liked my 
		writing enough to let me compose segments for their monthly newsletter.  As my termination date would grow nearer, they would extend my assignment.  This continued as they encouraged me to apply to the full-time Community Outreach Coordinator position.  
		<p>And that is what i do now!  Nearly two years after graduation, i have landed a real job that requires a degree.  This walk took a long time—longer than i imagined while sitting in the library or the residence hall.  Whoever you are, wherever you are going, keep your eye on the future and never stop pushing.  Reflect on your strategy and work cleverly.  You are not above anything.  Have the patience to let your work speak for itself.  There are ten thousand lessons in peeling shrimp.
		<p>I recently visited Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh is a neat city with blue collar vibes and educated energy.  At least several people of whom you have 
		heard have origins in Pittsburgh: Rachel Carson, Andy Warhol, Mister Rogers, Mac Miller.  Consider it the Grand Rapids of Pennsylvania.  While there, i had the opportunity to go for a couple runs.  Always run on vacation; these parts are some of the most memorable—not for being the best parts, but for the brain chemistry.  And what a way to explore a place.  Anyway, my man VG Money took me around town and showed me the Andy Warhol Museum, the botanical gardens, and some hip spots for pierogies and Izakaya.</p>
		<h3 class="temp_hide">Africa</h3>
		<p><span class="temp_hide">Let me take us back to Africa for a little while.  I took a sixteen-hour plane ride to Gaborone, Botswana for a 
		semester abroad.  This is something i had really wanted to do, but it is also something we just do.  Doubt began swirling long before my plane ride and compounded after i landed.  Why was i here?  What was i to do with no language to learn and a bleak semi-arid zone stretched out before me?  I planned a trip east toward Mozambique, hoping that would be the cure, but ten to sixteen men jumped us in Johannesburg.  I ended up in a pretty dark place—an angry, despondent, anxious place for a lot of that trip.  
		<p><span class="temp_hide">But things started clearing up towards the end of my stay, perhaps partly because it was coming to close.  But i also made a ten-day excursion into Namibia, and that was exciting.  Donald Trump won the presidency and the motherfucking Republican party took the House and Senate while i was on the Atlantic coast in Swakopmund, which sullied an otherwise rapturous trip.  Namibia utterly changed me.  The Earth is a magnificent place.  Standing in the Sossusvlei, or sitting six feet from flamingos in Walvis Bay, or watching a thunderstorm tumble over the mountains around Windhoek and overtake you, you cannot shake the sense that this planet will one day rise up around you and swallow whole everything humanity falsely holds dear.  The sun beats down.  The frigid ocean rolls in and out.  The wind blows orange sand across your arms and legs, scrubbing away the old you.</span>
