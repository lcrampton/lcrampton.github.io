		<h1>Platform</h1>
		<h3 class="tagline">† neither partisan nor non-partisan †</h3><br>
		<!--<p class="tagline">_____</p>-->
		
		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>Recognizing the intrinsic, exhilarating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccAWioDHgQM">beauty of life</a>, this platform seeks to serve people and organize society in a way that achieves enlightenment in the greatest possible number and magnitude.&nbsp We aim to build a just, innovative, and enduring civilization on foundations of utilitarianism and sustainability.</p>
		
		<h2>Vision</h2>
		<p>A civilization of wise and healthy people lives in symbiosis with the ecosystem.&nbsp Resilient to shocks, they are able to trade widely, innovate rapidly, and explore the universe at will.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Env">Environment and Energy</h2>
		<p>The environment is within us and encompassing us.&nbsp It provides us invaluable services.&nbsp We require its integrity to survive.&nbsp With the power we have amassed, we can impact it significantly.&nbsp In eons past, burning oil and gas, combined with volcano activity, have released massive amounts of carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere, causing rapid climate change that led to mass extinctions.&nbsp We can engineer our own demise.&nbsp We only need to remain on the current course.</p>
		<p>We will pursue a rapid societal decarbonization.&nbsp The process may incur externalities related to productivity or transitory energy rationing.&nbsp We believe such frictions to be acceptable in the face of the compounding costs of climate change.</p>
		<h3>A Smart Grid</h3>
		<p>We need to allow for and encourage the implementation of nuclear power.&nbsp Nuclear waste is a grave issue, but the time for easy choices has come and gone.</p>
		<p>We will, over a period of twenty years, close down ninety-nine percent of power plants running on fossil fuels.&nbsp This will begin with the most polluting coal plants, proceed to oil-burning plants, and continue to natural gas-burning plants.&nbsp Simultaneously, we will massively ramp up our adoption of renewable and nuclear energy generation.&nbsp State funds will finance solar arrays, rooftop solar, wind farms, and tidal turbines.&nbsp We will extend low-interest financing and tax credits for their construction.&nbsp </p>
		<p>Sales of internal combustion cars are eventually going to become highly restricted.&nbsp At the state level, we can utilize funds for highways and rest stops to install vehicular charging stations near rest stops and attractions.&nbsp These would be either connected to the grid at large or, in more remote areas, solar- or wind-powered solid-state storage cells.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Climate">Climate Change</h2>
		<p>How are we going to mitigate and adapt to our changing climate?  This is the question facing our civilization at this critical juncture.&nbsp The state, as the protector of its citizenry and guarantor of macroeconomic stability, has a clear prerogative to intervene.&nbsp As climate change presents an existential threat to human civilization, the state can ethically spare no expense to avert catastrophe.</p>
			<h3>Biodiversity</h3>
			<p>Biodiversity is the storehouse of novel pharmacology.&nbsp Plants, fungi, and bacteria synthesize unique chemical compounds all over the world, sometimes in extremely limited geographic areas.&nbsp Pharmaceutical prospecting in remote (micro)biomes is not uncommon.&nbsp To combat the worldwide anthropocene decline in biodiversity we will</p>
			<ol>
				<li>combat climate change</li>
				<li>create large and uninterrupted nature reserves</li>
				<li>as a backstop, save genetic material of threatened species in vaults</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h2 id="Econ">The Government and the Economy</h2>
		<p>The ecosystem does not <em>depend</em> on the economy.&nbsp The ecosystem is not <em>at odds</em> with the economy.&nbsp The environment is the economy.&nbsp The economy is how we distribute the resources on planet earth.&nbsp The fight for ecological integrity is the fight for the elimination of poverty and for abundance.</p>
		<p>The government has a role to play in the economy.&nbsp It can smooth out dips and booms with discretionary fiscal policy, support households with social welfare, and step in where the interests of the public diverge from capital interests.</p>
		
		<h3>Economic Justice</h3>
		<p>The state will intervene to ensure that all citizens have equitable opportunity to upward social mobility.</p>
		<p>We need a government that can reliably deliver the basics.&nbsp Nobody should have to go hungry in a country that produces so much wealth.&nbsp We will institute the <b>steel lunchbox</b>, a guarantee of nutritive food and clean water for every citizen.&nbsp We will implement the steel lunchbox through
		<ul><li>an expansion of food stamps that bolsters benefits and includes residents up to 150-200% of the poverty income threshold</li>
		<li>government partnerships with (funding of) food banks, soup kitchens, and other community programs that feed people where they are</li>
		<li>school cafeterias.&nbsp 
		
		<h3>Taxes, Deficits, and Debt</h3>
		<p>Artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/05/1001142/ai-reinforcement-learning-simulate-economy-fairer-tax-policy-income-inequality-recession-pandemic/">will assist</a> in laying out optimal tax policy.&nbsp "Optimal" tax policy is fair, facilitates growth, and generates sufficient revenue.</p>
		<p>Sufficient revenue balances the budget over the long term.&nbsp Here, the long term is a period of about thirty years.</p>
		<p>We recognize the stabilizing effects of government debt on financial markets, and will issue debt when circumstances demand it.&nbsp However, expenditures on debt service draw resources away from our social safety net and the kinds of investments that power sustainable growth.</p>
		<p>Where public pensions restrain government budgets to such an extent that they undermine social welfare, they should undergo reform.&nbsp As people live longer and outlive expectations on average, the state may have to adjust its obligations in order to maintain a sustainable system for everybody.&nbsp We will establish an official life expectancy, scientifically determined in concert between the Departments of Labor and Health & Human Services.&nbsp We would like to tie the age at which social security distributions begin to eighty-five percent of the life expectancy and the age at which pension distributions begin to eighty-two percent.&nbsp This aids the sustainability of social security and public pensions while creating an incentive for the government not to allow life expectancies to backslide.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Health">Health</h2>
		<p>Health is among the least culturally relative goals.&nbsp The government, as part of its mandate to ensure its citizens' safety, can play a role in promoting healthy lifestyles and mitigating health risks among its citizenry.</p>
		<h3>Health Insurance and Cost-Bearing</h3>
		<p>There should be a public health insurance option available and affordable to every citizen.</p>
		
		<h2 id="FP">Foreign Policy</h2>
		<h3>The Armed Forces</h3>
		<p>We will utilize the armed forces under a few specific circumstances:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>when protecting vulnerable people's lives and liberty when threatened by more powerful actors</li>
				<ul><li>preventing genocide</li></ul>
			<li>when providing matériel to relief efforts in the wake of disasters</li>
				<ul><li>demarcating perimeters of safety through which aid and/or noncombatant evacuees can pass</li></ul>
		</ul>
		<h3>Nuclear Weapons</h3>
		<p>We will try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in our stockpile, in proportion to reductions in the Russian Federation's stockpile.&nbsp We will convene the major nuclear powers of the world for a proportionate reduction in nuclear weapons.&nbsp Eventually, we will dismantle the remaining nuclear weapons simultaneously under the eye of international observer parties.&nbsp We will allow the United Nations to retain fewer than ten to use exclusively in the event of imminent asteroid impact.</p>
		<p>We will continue to develop ordinance that could safely block ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads.&nbsp These lower the leverage of rogue states with few warheads, and may save lives in the event of all-out nuclear war.&nbsp We will reserve the right to deploy anti-ballistic missiles in South Korea on the border with North Korea.&nbsp We will seek an international ban on tactical nuclear weapons, which could make escalation to all-out nuclear warfare more likely.</p>
		<h3>Russia</h3>
		<p>Russia seeks to sow chaos in the world order, and makes the world less secure in doing so.&nbsp  As its power and economy decline, Russia's leadership and arms manufacturers stand to benefit from the reticence of global superpowers.&nbsp And all this at the expense of Russia's people.&nbsp To contain Russia and similarly aggressive regional powers, we must bring our economic and diplomatic influence to bear.</p>
		<h3>China</h3>
		<p>We will strengthen allyship with liberal democracies in Asia to counterbalance the authoritarian style of Chinese government.</p>
		<p>We will advocate for the liberty and cultural continuity of the Uigher and Tibetan people.</p>
		<p>We will press and encourage China to ease its restrictions on immigration and accept more refugees from North Korea.
		<h3>Humanitarianism</h3>
		<h4>Relief</h4>
		<p>The federal government will provide resources to supranational relief efforts in the wake of natural and man-made disasters, to include food, material goods such as blankets, essential medicine, qualified personnel, and emergency infrastructure such as water purification.</p>
		<h4>Military Intervention</h4>
		<p>The federal government will attempt multilateral solutions to outbreaks of conflict with high casualties.&nbsp Failing multilateral and diplomatic solution, the federal government will reserve the right to intervene in order to prevent massive casualties.&nbsp We will do everything in our power to prevent additional instances of genocide.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Borders">Immigration and Naturalization</h2>
		<p>Every asylum-seeker deserves to have their case heard.&nbsp We will hire and train additional case workers to work through pending asylum cases.&nbsp This will include a reserve group of adjunct case workers, who are equally qualified, but called upon to assess anomalous waves of asylum-seekers.</p>
		<p>We will maintain and systematize DACA and Temporary Protected Status.&nbsp Those who grow up in the United States deserve a path to citizenship.&nbsp Those to whom we grant residency on account of untenable conditions in their home country should not have to return as long as those countries remain dangerous or unstable.&nbsp Residents of the United States under TPS should be able to make a case for non-delimited asylum and seek citizenship after a period of ten to fifteen years of residence.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Rural">Rural Development</h2>
		<h3>Arable Land</h3>
		<p>The price of meat should incorporate the cost of its deleterious effects on society and the environment.&nbsp Our administration would seek to end farm subsidies for any crops that harm the environment or diminish public health.&nbsp These could include conventional beef, pork, and poulty; feed like dent corn and ryegrass; sugar cane and sugar beets; and water-intense crops grown in areas of drought like almonds or avocados.</p>
		<p>We want to encourage efficient use of our fertile lands.&nbsp And we want to ensure that future generations have the opportunity to utilize that land as well.</p>
		
		<h3>Parks and Conservation</h3>
		<p>Parks and reserves provide us with important ecological services.&nbsp They serve as grounds for studies in biology and environmental studies.&nbsp Park can also enrich their surrounding communities with recurring tourism revenue.&nbsp We will seek to establish and expand parks and reserves as an integral part of maintaining biodiversity and developing a sustainable economy.</p>
		
		<h2 id="City">Urban Development</h2>
		<p>America's population is growing fastest in its urban and suburban areas.&nbsp Cities offer the most efficient and ecological way to settle people.&nbsp Additionally, by facilitating access to labor and ideas, they tend to generate growth and innovation.&nbsp The state, when zoning and writing tax codes, should never incentivize post-war style suburban development, which multiplies the ecological impact of families and stretches public resources.&nbsp We will cease subsidizing exclusive and inefficient development.</p>
		<p>Urban density presents a challenge during times of plague.&nbsp Robust public health infrastructure and a culture of solidarity can make areas of dense settlement as safe as or safer than suburban settlement.&nbsp This requires the following:</p>
		<ul><li>widespread availability of testing</li>
		<li>strategic stockpiles of medical equipment such as masks, gloves, hazmat suits, and distilled water</li>
		<li>a surplus of intensive care units and equipment like ventilators and dialyzers</li>
		<li>availability of living units for quarantine</li>
		<li>subject matter experts in proximity to policy leaders, who formulate and execute emergency planning</li></ul>
		<p>We will ban leaf blowers.&nbsp These are a noisy and polluting solution to a non-existent problem that could be solved with brooms and rakes.&nbsp The noise they generate impacts the mental well-being of citizens.&nbsp Gas-powered models utilize single-stroke motors that can pollute more than a car in the same amount of time.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Crime">Criminal Justice</h2>
		<p>Our criminal justice system needs to focus on rehabilitation, not on profit.</p>
		<!--One innocent person in one hundred thousand defendants could go to jail, with parole hearings, in an acceptable justice system.&nbsp Fewer than one in one million should die in prison while incarcerated for crimes they did not commit.&nbsp Conversely, we are willing to accept one in five thousand guilty defendants walking out of their trials free.&nbsp Our justice system should prioritize rehabilitation.&nbsp-->
		<h3>Ending the drug war</h3>
        <p>We will decriminalize possession of all drugs.&nbsp We will legalize the sale, possession, and consumption of marijuana and marijuana-derived products.&nbsp The sale of narcotics, amphetamines, and psychedelics will remain tightly regulated.&nbsp We will decriminalize small-batch manufacture of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic diethylamide and psilocybin mushrooms.&nbsp The Food and Drug Administration will conduct research on these chemicals, and continue research on tetrahydocannabinol and cannabidiol.</p>
		<p>The state will utilize discretionary health spending for substance abuse rehabilitation centers.&nbsp Paid state agents with training in social work will address patterns of substance abuse.&nbsp The state or its partners in civil society will provide clean needles to users of intravenous drugs, and collect and dispose of used needles, while offering tests for diseases spread by sharing of needles.&nbsp In addition, the state will decline to arrest in cases of experimental harm-reduction strategies such as safe supply.</p>
		<h3>The death penalty</h3>
		<p>The state shall not carry out capital punishment on its citizens.&nbsp The preventative power of the death penalty is suspect.&nbsp Any such effect is not worth the expense of holding inmates on death row and carrying out executions.&nbsp The gravest sentence shall be life without parole.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Reform">Government Reform</h2>
		<p>We will adjust for the encroaching power of the executive branch and office of the president.&nbsp The law shall not be helpless against a president keen to ignore it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reinstate the Interim Committee with exclusive authority over the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons.&nbsp Retaliatory nuclear strikes would remain the prerogative of the President.</li>
			<li>We will revoke the Presdient's privilege to pardon for contempt of court.</li>
			<li>We will require presidents to disclose assets and sources of income, and place them in blind trusts and/or divest from individual companies.</li>
			<li>We will amend the constitution to enumerate the number of seats on supreme courts.&nbsp The number shall be odd.&nbsp We may seek to add seats once in order to modernize the courts, but we aim to deter court-packing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The founders intended to establish a republic without political parties; reality bore them anyway.&nbsp Recognizing this reality, we will seek a more responsive electoral system, which does not grant dispropotionate power to populous swing states.&nbsp This may include replacing the first-past-the-post elections system with a proportional representation system and abolishing the electoral college.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Territories">Territories and Minor Outlying Islands</h2>
		<h3>Representation for the District of Columbia</h3>
		<p>The District of Columbia will receive representation in the House of Representatives and Senate.&nbsp On the way to two senators and a number of representatives reflective of its population (one for the present time), it may receive one senator, but this shall not impede progress to full representation in Congress.</p>
		<p>The District of Columbia contains seven hundred thousand people—more than Wyoming or Vermont—
		<h3>An Ultimatum for Permanently Inhabited Territories</h3>
		<p>The five inhabited territories must either become independent countries or begin the path to statehood.&nbsp Each territory will hold a referendum within five years.</p>
		<p>Territorial possessions are anachronistic vestiges of an imperial America.&nbsp We can maintain the military strategic advantages they confer with arrangements similar to those in Japan, Germany, and Guantánamo Bay.&nbsp The territory system, as is, creates legal loopholes and systematizes second-class citizenship (or non-citizenship, in the case of American Samoa) for nearly four million people.</p>
		<h3>Uninhabited Outlying Islands</h3>
		<p>We will maintain these posessions as areas of conservation, scientific inquiry, and/or military outposts where prudent.</p>
		<h3>Antarctic Claims</h3>
