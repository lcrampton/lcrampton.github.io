		<h1>Platform</h1>
		<h3 class="tagline">† neither partisan nor non-partisan †</h3><br>
		<!--<p class="tagline">_____</p>-->
		
		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>Recognizing the intrinsic, exhilarating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccAWioDHgQM">beauty of life</a>, this platform seeks to serve people and organize society in a way that achieves enlightenment in the greatest possible number and magnitude.&nbsp We aim to build a just, innovative, and enduring civilization on foundations of utilitarianism and sustainability.</p>
		
		<h2>Vision</h2>
		<p>A civilization of wise and healthy people lives in symbiosis with the ecosystem.&nbsp Resilient to shocks, they are able to trade widely, innovate rapidly, and explore the universe at will.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Env">Environment and Energy</h2>
			<p>The environment is within us and encompassing us.&nbsp It provides us invaluable services.&nbsp We require its integrity to survive.&nbsp With the power we have amassed, we can impact it significantly.&nbsp In eons past, burning oil and gas, combined with volcanic activity, have released massive amounts of carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere, causing rapid climate change that led to mass extinctions.&nbsp We can engineer our own demise.&nbsp We only need to remain on the current course.</p>
			<p>We will pursue a rapid societal decarbonization.&nbsp We are calling for massive, emergency-level investment.&nbsp The process may incur externalities related to productivity or transitory energy rationing.&nbsp We believe such frictions to be acceptable in the face of the compounding costs of climate change.</p>
			<h3>A Smart Grid</h3>
				<p>We need to allow for and encourage the implementation of nuclear power.&nbsp Nuclear energy generation is massively safer than fossil fuels, and can be extremely safe when implemented properly.&nbsp The technology already exists, is easy to scale, and easy to incorporate into the grid.&nbsp It avoids the issues renewables face with peak-generation and ramping.&nbsp And it produces negligible air pollution.&nbsp Radioactive waste is a long-term challenge, but the volume of waste would actually be quite low, and the time for easy choices has come and gone.&nbsp France is an example of a country that sources most of its energy from nuclear generation.</p>
				<p>We will, over a period of twenty years, close down ninety-nine percent of power plants running on fossil fuels.&nbsp This will begin with the most polluting coal plants, proceed to oil-burning plants, and continue to natural gas-burning plants.&nbsp Simultaneously, we will massively ramp up our adoption of renewable and nuclear energy generation.&nbsp State funds will finance solar arrays, rooftop solar, wind farms, and tidal turbines.&nbsp We will extend low-interest financing and tax credits for their construction.&nbsp </p>
				<p>Sales of internal combustion cars are eventually going to become highly restricted.&nbsp At the state level, we can utilize funds for highways and rest stops to install vehicular charging stations near rest stops and attractions.&nbsp These would be either connected to the grid at large or, in more remote areas, solar- or wind-powered solid-state storage cells.</p>
				<p>We will provide low-interest financing for insulation and efficiency improvements.&nbsp This is to include adopting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFEHFsO-XSI">heat pumps</a> for home heating, which can replace gas heating.</p>
				<p>We must also update our aging transmission infrastructure to accommodate changes in generation methods, population shifts, and better standards in fire safety.</p>
			<h3>Biodiversity</h3>
				<p>Biodiversity is the storehouse of novel pharmacology.&nbsp Plants, fungi, and bacteria synthesize unique chemical compounds all over the world, sometimes in extremely limited geographic areas.&nbsp Pharmaceutical prospecting in remote (micro)biomes is not uncommon.&nbsp To combat the worldwide anthropocene decline in biodiversity we will</p>
				<ol>
					<li>combat climate change</li>
					<li>create large and uninterrupted nature reserves</li>
					<li>as a backstop, save genetic material of threatened species in vaults</li>
				</ol>
			<h3>Water</h3>
				<p>Several parts of the world face drastic water scarcity as patterns of heat, precipitation, and population change.</p>
				<p>In areas of aridification, we may impose restrictions on water usage to prioritize water for drinking.&nbsp This could include bans on lawn-watering and limitations on vehicle-washing.&nbsp We can encourage xeroscaping and rain-capturing architecture.
				</p>
		
		<h2 id="Climate">Climate Change</h2>
		<p>How are we going to mitigate and adapt to our changing climate?&nbsp This is the question facing our civilization at this critical juncture.&nbsp The state, as the protector of its citizenry and guarantor of macroeconomic stability, has a clear prerogative to intervene.&nbsp As climate change presents an existential threat to human civilization, the state can ethically spare no expense to avert catastrophe.</p>
		<p>We need to begin with mitigation.&nbsp We cannot expect to keep up with the rate of change if we continue to accelerate the rate of greenhouse gas emission.</p>
		<p>Then, we need to adapt.&nbsp Enough warming is baked in to the future to destabilize our civilization.&nbsp We need drastic overhaul of immigration and humanitarian systems, a reimagination of coastal settlement, and investment in proactive diplomacy to diminish the damage and instability that climate change will cause, even if we stop polluting tomorrow.</p>
		<p>Third, we have an obligation to our descendants to go on a climate offensive, planting forests and improving carbon capture technology to make it cost-effective and carbon-negative.&nbsp This technology is not yet ready for wide deployment, nor does it offer an alternative to switching from fossil fuels.&nbsp But it will eventually play a role in reversing the damage.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Health">Health</h2>
		<p>Health is among the least culturally relative goals.&nbsp The government, as part of its mandate to ensure its citizens' safety, can play a role in promoting healthy lifestyles and mitigating health risks among its citizenry.</p>
			<h3>Health Insurance and Cost-Bearing</h3>
			<p>There should be a public health insurance option available and affordable to every citizen.&nbsp We may need to increase the tax burden on individuals, but public health insurance, such as Medicare, entails fewer costs than private health insurers.&nbsp Medicare does not have to spend on marketing or executive compensation, nor does need to turn a profit.&nbsp Furthermore, it benefits from economies of scale.</p>
			<h3>Abortion</h3>
			<p>Abortion is healthcare.&nbsp We will maintain and reclaim the legality of abortion.&nbsp We are willing to legalize it at all stages of pregnancy.&nbsp The public health insurance option will cover abortions.</p>
			
		
		<h2 id="Econ">The Government and the Economy</h2>
		<p>The ecosystem does not <em>depend</em> on the economy.&nbsp The ecosystem is not <em>at odds</em> with the economy.&nbsp The environment is the economy.&nbsp The economy is how we distribute the resources on planet earth.&nbsp The fight for ecological integrity is the fight for the elimination of poverty and for abundance.</p>
		<p>The government has a role to play in the economy.&nbsp It can smooth out dips and booms with discretionary fiscal policy, support households with social welfare, and step in where the interests of the public diverge from capital interests.</p>
			<h3>Economic Justice</h3>
			<p>The state will intervene to ensure that all citizens have equitable opportunity to upward social mobility.</p>
			<p>We need a government that can reliably deliver the basics.&nbsp Nobody should have to go hungry in a country that produces so much wealth.&nbsp We will institute the <b>steel lunchbox</b>, a guarantee of nutritive food and clean water for every citizen.&nbsp We will implement the steel lunchbox through
				<ul>
					<li>an expansion of food stamps that bolsters benefits and includes residents up to 150-200% of the poverty income threshold</li>
					<li>government partnerships with (funding of) food banks, soup kitchens, and other community programs that feed people where they are</li>
					<li>school cafeterias.&nbsp </li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Taxes, Deficits, and Debt</h3>
			<p>Artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/05/1001142/ai-reinforcement-learning-simulate-economy-fairer-tax-policy-income-inequality-recession-pandemic/">will assist</a> in laying out optimal tax policy.&nbsp "Optimal" tax policy is fair, facilitates growth, and generates sufficient revenue.</p>
			<p>Sufficient revenue balances the budget over the long term.&nbsp Here, the long term is a period of about thirty years.</p>
			<p>We recognize the stabilizing effects of government debt on financial markets, and will issue debt when circumstances demand it.&nbsp However, expenditures on debt service draw resources away from our social safety net and the kinds of investments that power sustainable growth.</p>
			<p>Where public pensions restrain government budgets to such an extent that they undermine social welfare, they should undergo reform.&nbsp As people live longer and outlive expectations on average, the state may have to adjust its obligations in order to maintain a sustainable system for everybody.&nbsp We will establish an official life expectancy, scientifically determined in concert between the Departments of Labor and Health & Human Services.&nbsp We would like to tie the age at which social security distributions begin to eighty-five percent of the life expectancy and the age at which pension distributions begin to eighty-two percent.&nbsp This aids the sustainability of social security and public pensions while creating an incentive for the government not to allow life expectancies to backslide.</p>
			
		<h2 id="Edu">Education</h2>
		<p>Every child deserves access to a quality public education, at least grades Kindergarten to twelve.&nbsp Most public school systems need to increase teacher pay, but also support teachers in necessary ways: modern supplies in classrooms, employee assistance programs, allowing collective bargaining, and protecting staff from radical parents.</p>
		<p>As it stands, effective education remains a scarcity exclusively available to the privileged.&nbsp We have the resources to make every public school nearly equally excellent.&nbsp Often, archaic tax regimes and radical interest groups prevent that, at the expense of the public.&nbsp We can create an educational utopia in a generation if we set our priorities straight.&nbsp Education expenditures realize public value up to eight times their cost, through improvements in productivity and public safety.&nbsp It is time we made good on our promises and made the system work for everyone.</p>
		<p>Private schools will be allowed to continue operating.&nbsp Parents who send their children to private schools will not be exempt from taxes that fund education.&nbsp We will oppose voucher systems that pull resources away from struggling schools.&nbsp We will not ban charter schools outright, but given their overall record, they deserve scrutiny.&nbsp Homeschooling will be allowed to continue with viable curricula.</p>
		<p>Public schools will remain secular in their scholarship.&nbsp Supernaturalist frameworks (such as creationism or millennialism) will be excluded from unrelated curricla such as biology and geology.&nbsp We will neither encourage nor discourage prayer.</p>
			<h3>Student Loan Forgiveness</h3>
			<p>We do not want to <strong>only</strong> forgive student loans.&nbsp Free public higher education is good, but we have to ask if student loan forgiveness is a <strong>net</strong> good, worth the opportunity cost.&nbsp We have failing primary schools, and as long as that is happening, how can we justify expenditures on something that, even if means tested, will primarily benefit people with a college degree—with presumably enhanced job prospects?</p>
			<p>We aim to create a fair and effective education system.&nbsp That could include free tuition at state and community colleges.&nbsp But we do not have unlimited resources, and we should start by getting the basics right.</p>
			
		<h2 id="FP">Foreign Policy</h2>
		<h3>The Armed Forces</h3>
			<p>We want to support our military, and continuously enhance its capabilities in line with our doctrine.&nbsp But that should mean utilizing the military only in pursuit of worthwhile and attainable objectives.&nbsp At all times, experts should question and improve the country's defense doctrine to reflect changing geopolitical realities.&nbsp We will utilize the armed forces under a few specific circumstances:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>when protecting vulnerable people's lives and liberty when threatened by more powerful actors</li>
					<ul><li>preventing genocide</li></ul>
				<li>enforcing certain international norms, such as self-determination</li>
				<li>when providing matériel to relief efforts in the wake of disasters</li>
					<ul><li>demarcating perimeters of safety through which aid and/or noncombatant evacuees can pass</li></ul>
				<li>self-defense</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We hope to reduce spending in this area by in-housing certain experts and bureaucratic functions.&nbsp We can share capabilities among allies and security partners.&nbsp There also appear to be redundancies and instances of overspending.</p>
		<h3>Humanitarianism</h3>
			<h4>Relief</h4>
				<p>The federal government will provide resources to supranational relief efforts in the wake of natural and man-made disasters, to include food, material goods such as blankets, essential medicine, qualified personnel, and emergency infrastructure such as water purification.</p>
			<h4>Military Intervention</h4>
				<p>The federal government will attempt multilateral solutions to outbreaks of conflict with high casualties.&nbsp Failing multilateral and diplomatic solution, the federal government will reserve the right to intervene in order to prevent massive casualties.&nbsp We will do everything in our power to prevent additional instances of genocide.</p>
		<h3>Nuclear Weapons</h3>
			<p>We will try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in our stockpile, in proportion to reductions in the Russian Federation's stockpile.&nbsp We will convene the major nuclear powers of the world for a proportionate reduction in nuclear weapons.&nbsp Eventually, we will dismantle the remaining nuclear weapons simultaneously under the eye of international observer parties.&nbsp We will allow the United Nations to retain fewer than ten to use exclusively in the event of imminent asteroid impact.</p>
			<p>There must be severe consequences for rogue states that develop or attempt to develop chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons.</p>
			<p>We will continue to develop ordinance that could safely block ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads.&nbsp These lower the leverage of rogue states with few warheads, and may save lives in the event of all-out nuclear war.&nbsp We will reserve the right to deploy anti-ballistic missiles in South Korea on the border with North Korea.&nbsp We will seek an international ban on tactical nuclear weapons, which could make escalation to all-out nuclear warfare more likely.</p>
		
		<h3>Afghanistan</h3>
			<p>The invasion and occupation of Afghanistan was likely ill-conceived, and should have ended much sooner than it did.&nbsp At many points and at many levels, our military mishandled it.&nbsp However, the invasion did provide a generation opportunities for education and freedom which the Taliban now denies them.&nbsp It may be possible—and indeed more fruitful—to encourage Afghanistan to liberalize without putting troops on its soil.</p>
		<h3>Australia</h3>
			<p>Australia is a solid partner in the Pacific region.&nbsp We will continue to invest in this relationship as we create a ring of prosperous democracy in the Pacific.</p>
			<p>Australia stands at the nexus of several environmental issues.&nbsp While it has the means to resettle peoples entirely displaced by sea-level rise (such as the Maldives), it also faces aridification and biome collapse along the Great Barrier Reef.&nbsp So while the world may rely on it over the course of the coming centuries, it may also require assistance.</p>
		<h3>Canada</h3>
			<p>We will seek to ease and facilitate transit between the United States and one of its top trading partners.</p>
		<h3>China</h3>
			<p>We will strengthen allyship with liberal democracies in Asia to counterbalance the authoritarian style of Chinese government.&nbsp In this vein, we will support Taiwan's strength and independence.&nbsp It is a functional democracy of twenty-three million people with over seventy years of history separate from the People's Republic, and its people deserve self-determination.</p>
			<p>We will advocate for the liberty and cultural continuity of the Uigher and Tibetan people.&nbsp This will begin with diplomatic overtures and could escalate to specific economic sanctions to discourage and disrupt the eradication of these cultures.</p>
			<p>We will press and encourage China to ease its restrictions on immigration and accept more refugees from North Korea.</p>
		<h3>Iran</h3>
			<p>We will seek a general détente with Iran and normalization of relations.&nbsp Iran is only a few reforms away from illiberal democracy.</p>
			<p>They should be heavily discouraged from developing a nuclear weapon, though they should be allowed to generate nuclear power.&nbsp The JCPOA was a positive step for nuclear non-proliferation and for US-Iranian relations.</p>
		<h3>North Korea</h3>
			<p>We will, ultimately, pursue regime change in North Korea and reunification of Korea.&nbsp The people living under the Juche regime face immense duress under a hypermilitaristic system that does not serve them.&nbsp Regime change and reunification are bound to be chaotic; the region will require international assistance in setting North Korea on a healthy course.</p>
		<h3>Russia</h3>
			<p>Russia seeks to sow chaos in the world order, and makes the world less secure in doing so.&nbsp As its power and economy decline, Russia's leadership and arms manufacturers stand to benefit from the reticence of global superpowers.&nbsp And all this at the expense of Russia's people.&nbsp We will utilize precise economic sanctions and diplomatic influence to contain Russia and similarly aggressive regional powers.</p>
			<p>We will not seek a forceful regime change, but we will be prepared for both the inevitable end of Putin's leadership and the possibility of changes in or collapse of the current illiberal regime.</p>
			<p>Simultaneously, the United States will need Russia's collaboration on nuclear disarmament.&nbsp We will seek to build on the progress of SALT and demonstrate leadership in nuclear drawdown in partnership with Russia</p>
			<p>Economic sanctions will continue and intensify as the war in Ukraine drags on, and to punish Putin's transgressions against humanitarian norms there.</p>
		<h3>South Korea</h3>
			<p>South Korea is an important democratic ally in the Pacific region.&nbsp We will seek to support its sovereign integrity and eventual reunification.&nbsp This may include the stationing of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missiles in South Korea, with its consent.</p>
			<p>The United States should officially apologize for the No Gun Ri massacre and support independent investigation.</p>
		<h3>Taiwan</h3>
			<p>Taiwan shall proceed with maximum independence.&nbsp Diplomacy in this area cannot ignore that Taiwanese (<a href="https://www.tpof.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/20220426-TPOF-April-2022-Public-Opinion-Poll-%E2%80%93-English-Excerpt.pdf">increasingly</a>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_on_Taiwanese_identity">want</a> to be <a href="https://www.tpof.org/%e5%85%a9%e5%b2%b8%e9%97%9c%e4%bf%82/%e5%85%a9%e5%b2%b8%e6%94%bf%e6%b2%bb/%e7%b8%bd%e7%b5%b1%e8%81%b2%e6%9c%9b%e3%80%81%e7%b5%b1%e7%8d%a8%e5%82%be%e5%90%91%e8%88%87%e5%85%a9%e5%b2%b8%e9%97%9c%e4%bf%82%ef%bc%9a%e7%8f%be%e9%9a%8e%e6%ae%b5%e5%8f%b0%e7%81%a3%e4%ba%ba%e6%b0%91-4/">independent</a> and democratic.</p>
		<h3>Ukraine</h3>
			<p>Ukraine deserves self-determination.&nbsp It deserves to foster its young democracy independent of or in partnership with its neighbors.</p>
			<p>In light of the present war for continuity, we would underwrite Ukraine's wartime expenditures.&nbsp We would also supply weapons and training to the Ukrainian military.&nbsp After the war, a free and fair referendum in Crimea regarding its possession may be appropriate.</p>
			<p>Ukraine shall receive any necessary assistance from the international community in responsibly containing the fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Borders">Immigration and Naturalization</h2>
		<p>Every asylum-seeker deserves to have their case heard.&nbsp We will hire and train additional case workers to work through pending asylum cases.&nbsp That entails pay raises for immigration officials.&nbsp This will include a reserve group of adjunct case workers, who are equally qualified, but called upon to assess anomalous waves of asylum-seekers.</p>
		<p>We will maintain and systematize DACA and Temporary Protected Status.&nbsp Those who grow up in the United States deserve a path to citizenship.&nbsp Those to whom we grant residency on account of untenable conditions in their home country should not have to return as long as those countries remain dangerous or unstable.&nbsp Residents of the United States under TPS should be able to make a case for non-delimited asylum and seek citizenship after a period of ten to fifteen years of residence.</p>
		<p>We will roll back restrictions mutually with Canada to ease trade and transit across the US-Canada border.&nbsp This may include aligning the two countries' immigration policies.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Rural">Rural Development</h2>
		<h3>Arable Land</h3>
		<p>The price of meat should incorporate the cost of its deleterious effects on society and the environment.&nbsp Our administration would seek to end farm subsidies for any crops that harm the environment or diminish public health.&nbsp These could include conventional beef, pork, and poulty; feed like dent corn and ryegrass; sugar cane and sugar beets; and water-intense crops grown in areas of drought like almonds or avocados.</p>
		<p>Conversely, we may subsidize farms that can provide produce locally, as this benefits our communities and the environment.&nbsp We may also maintain subsidies for farms that produce staples at scale, for security reasons.</p>
		<p>We want to encourage efficient use of our fertile lands.&nbsp And we want to ensure that future generations have the opportunity to utilize that land as well.</p>
		
		<h3>Parks and Conservation</h3>
		<p>Parks and reserves provide us with important ecological services.&nbsp They serve as grounds for studies in biology and environmental studies.&nbsp Park can also enrich their surrounding communities with recurring tourism revenue.&nbsp We will seek to establish and expand parks and reserves as an integral part of maintaining biodiversity and developing a sustainable economy.</p>
		
		<h2 id="City">Urban Development</h2>
		<p>America's population is growing fastest in its urban and suburban areas.&nbsp Cities offer the most efficient and ecological way to settle people.&nbsp High-rise residences can reduce the land needs of a population.&nbsp Dense, mixed-use development can preclude the need for a personal car and increase residents' quality of life.&nbsp Additionally, by facilitating access to labor and ideas, they tend to generate growth and innovation.&nbsp We will encourage people in cities to <b>age in place</b> in order to maximize these societal benefits, and promote community-building.</p>
		<p>The state, when zoning and writing tax codes, should never incentivize post-war style suburban development.&nbsp Single-family (R1) zoning multiplies the ecological impact of families.&nbsp Furthermore, it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nw6qyyrTeI">stretches public resources</a> in municipalities that already struggle financially to update infrastructure and provide public services.&nbsp Suburban development requires far more miles of roads and utilities—financed with taxes—than denser urban living.&nbsp We will cease subsidizing exclusive and inefficient development.</p>
		<p>Urban density presents a challenge during times of plague.&nbsp Robust public health infrastructure and a culture of solidarity can make areas of dense settlement as safe as or safer than suburban settlement.&nbsp This requires the following:</p>
		<ul><li>widespread availability of testing</li>
		<li>strategic stockpiles of medical equipment such as masks, gloves, hazmat suits, and distilled water</li>
		<li>a surplus of intensive care units and equipment like ventilators and dialyzers</li>
		<li>availability of living units for quarantine</li>
		<li>subject matter experts in proximity to policy leaders, who formulate and execute emergency planning</li></ul>
		<p>We will ban leaf blowers.&nbsp These are a noisy and polluting solution to a non-existent problem that could be solved with brooms and rakes.&nbsp The noise they generate impacts the mental well-being of citizens.&nbsp Gas-powered models utilize single-stroke motors that can pollute more than a car in the same amount of time.&nbsp In nature, fallen leaves form the rich layer of humus in which new life takes root.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Crime">Criminal Justice</h2>
		<p>Our criminal justice system needs to focus on rehabilitation, not on profit.</p>
		<!--One innocent person in one hundred thousand defendants could go to jail, with parole hearings, in an acceptable justice system.&nbsp Fewer than one in one million should die in prison while incarcerated for crimes they did not commit.&nbsp Conversely, we are willing to accept one in five thousand guilty defendants walking out of their trials free.&nbsp Our justice system should prioritize rehabilitation.&nbsp-->
		<h3>Ending the drug war</h3>
        <p>We will decriminalize possession of all drugs.&nbsp We will legalize the sale, possession, and consumption of marijuana and marijuana-derived products.&nbsp The sale of narcotics, amphetamines, and psychedelics will remain tightly regulated.&nbsp We will decriminalize small-batch manufacture of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic diethylamide and psilocybin mushrooms.&nbsp The Food and Drug Administration will conduct research on these chemicals, and continue research on tetrahydocannabinol and cannabidiol.</p>
		<p>The state will utilize discretionary health spending for substance abuse rehabilitation centers.&nbsp Paid state agents with training in social work will address patterns of substance abuse.&nbsp The state or its partners in civil society will provide clean needles to users of intravenous drugs, and collect and dispose of used needles, while offering tests for diseases spread by sharing of needles.&nbsp In addition, the state will decline to arrest in cases of experimental harm-reduction strategies such as safe supply.</p>
		<h3>The death penalty</h3>
		<p>The state shall not carry out capital punishment on its citizens.&nbsp The preventative power of the death penalty is suspect.&nbsp Any such effect is not worth the expense of holding inmates on death row and carrying out executions.&nbsp The gravest sentence shall be life without parole.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Reform">Government Reform</h2>
		<p>We will adjust for the encroaching power of the executive branch and Office of the President.&nbsp The law shall not be helpless against a president keen to ignore it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reinstate the Interim Committee with exclusive authority over the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons.&nbsp Retaliatory nuclear strikes would remain the prerogative of the President.</li>
			<li>We will revoke the Presdient's privilege to pardon for contempt of court.</li>
			<li>We will require presidents to disclose assets and sources of income, and place them in blind trusts and/or divest from individual companies.</li>
			<li>We will amend the constitution to enumerate the number of seats on supreme courts.&nbsp The number shall be odd.&nbsp We may seek to add seats once in order to modernize the courts, but we aim to deter court-packing.</li>

		<p>The founders intended to establish a republic without political parties; reality bore them anyway.&nbsp Recognizing this reality, we will seek a more responsive electoral system, which does not grant dispropotionate power to populous swing states.&nbsp This may include replacing the first-past-the-post elections system with a proportional representation system and abolishing the electoral college.</p>

		<h3>Representation for the District of Columbia</h3>
		<p>The District of Columbia will receive representation in the House of Representatives and Senate.&nbsp On the way to two senators and a number of representatives reflective of its population (one for the present time), it may receive one senator, but this shall not impede progress to full representation in Congress.</p>
		<p>The District of Columbia contains seven hundred thousand people—more than Wyoming or Vermont—
		<h3>An Ultimatum for Permanently Inhabited Territories</h3>
		<p>The five inhabited territories must either become independent countries or begin the path to statehood.&nbsp Each territory will hold a referendum within five years.</p>
		<p>Territorial possessions are anachronistic vestiges of an imperial America.&nbsp We can maintain the military strategic advantages they confer with arrangements similar to those in Japan, Germany, and Guantánamo Bay.&nbsp The territory system, as is, creates legal loopholes and systematizes second-class citizenship (or non-citizenship, in the case of American Samoa) for nearly four million people.</p>
		<h3>Uninhabited Outlying Islands</h3>
		<p>We will maintain these posessions as areas of conservation, scientific inquiry, and/or military outposts where prudent.</p>
		<h3>Antarctic Claims</h3>
		<p>Antarctica should remain a place of scientific inquiry and cooperation.&nbsp We may reserve the right to our claims in Antarctica, but will facilitate scientific exchange and will not enforce a hard border there.</p>
