		<h2>Fourth Meal at Annie's Paramount Steakhouse</h2>
		<h3>31/3/19</h3>
		<p>After hours of shimmying, swaying, popping, and locking, you are exhausted from hip to toe, and the profound hunger unique to the wee hours takes hold.  You shuffle eastward, without aim, as last calls punt revelers onto the </*ten-yard lines of the */>sidewalks.  As you pass shuttered establishments, you hear murmurs of a rumor of a legend.  Who is serving food to the weary of this night post-mortem?
		<p>Annie's is.
		<p>Annie's Paramount Steakhouse (not strictly a steakhouse, but <em>paramount</em> to one, i suppose) is that storied mecca of hospitality.  At the beginning of this year, the James Beard Foundation named Annie's an American Classic.  This is also the year of their seventy-fifth anniversary!  Annie's, in her enduring grace, opens its doors for twenty-four hours on weekends.  Now, why is DC so utterly devoid of such places?  What is so wrong with this city?  <span style="font-size:7px">It probably goes back to the height ordinance, but whatever.</span>
		<p>Of course, anybody could remain open all night.  But Annie's delivers quality diner grub, and that is what makes it a destination, not just a fancy 7-Eleven.  The employees of Annie's are missionaries; we are their flock.  They cut their fries wide and fry them hot so they are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  We can rest our weary heads there on the potato pillow.  They sautè mushrooms with care and slather them on the garden burger under ripe avocado.  Annie's food finds your nocturnal hunger pangs and knocks them the fuck out.
		<p>One dedicated waiter ran the whole packed floor that night.  Heroes wear aprons.  We tipped probably more than i ever have, except this one time at Red Robin...but i digress.  That guy has a job if i ever open my restaurant.
		<p>We sat beside Rubin and Freddie, who are, <a href="https://youtu.be/cK6EbAaUHj0?t=203">you know, <em>sisters</em></a>.  In the convivial, high-decibel atmosphere, it felt natural to converse with them.  But i started to wonder, out of statistical curiosity, why—and this is not to brag—so many dudes here were hitting on me.  We looked outside.  Lampposts bore the rainbow flag.  A banner of little pride flags decorated the threshold of a Subway<sup>®</sup>.  Men were kissing men.  Women deeply into the eyes of women.  Welcome to the gayborhood!  According to histories of DC, the LGBT community, cast out of mainstream society, moved into Logan Circle after the riots in the late sixties when property values were low and renovated the neighborhood.  They deserve this nice thing.</p>

		<h2>Lunch at Falafel Inc</h2>
		<h3>3/2/19</h3>
		<p>Falafel Inc.'s falafel ballas are light and fluffy.  The ingredients are ground and chopped finely, indicating the use of appliances.  These balls stood in opposition to the Amsterdam Falafel philosophy of falafel (falasophy?).  The falafel's supporting cast included red cabbage, hummus, pickles, and lettuce.  This was actually a quite straightforward sandwich, but nicely executed.  
		<p>Falafel Inc. rejects mod interior design, opting to bare their oriented strand board on the walls and ceiling.  Other fast-casual spots erect a wall between payments and kitchen areas.  Here, the register is embedded in the assembly line.  The deep belly of the kitchen—where fryers bubble and heavy machinery turns—lies in full view beyond the counter.  Their equivalent of tickets ringing in is the cashier leaning to the girl next to her and saying "two."
		<p>At four dollars, The sandwiches are <em>radically</em> inexpensive for Georgetown.  And a portion of Falafel Inc's revenue provides meals for refugees.  Humanitarianism and cuisine have always had intertwined values.  This facet of the Falafel Inc experience makes it more enjoyable, more significant, and more repeatable.  i hope they withstand the other falafel spots in their proximity.
		<p>Falafel, the jewel of the Levant, potentially breeds division or concordance, depending on context.  Falafel Inc deploys the fried goodies to sow peace.

		<h2>Piñata Apple</h2>
		<h3>19/1/19</h3>
		<p>This may be the tangiest apple i have encountered.  Its sourness could complement a crumble or a caramel sauce dip.  Its core has a high structural integrity.  O Piñata, are you a Granny Smith in disguise?  Please do not catfish my palette.</p>

		<h2>Dinner at The Shelby</p>
		<h3>20/12/18</h3>

alt="vegetable lasagna">
		<p>i have to take issue with the interior design at this establishment.  i considered taking a stand on only discussing the food but fuck it, this is 
		the Muffin Man Magookas eating experience blog; we do what we want!  A wall of pictures from the seventies flanked our table.  My heart sank a little 
		because this made me feel a little Ruby Tuesdayish.  Beyond my companion's head somebody had mounted a long mirror horizontally, so that i could 
		surveil other patrons and their dishes.  Above the mirror, a massive print of a woman's (presumably Shelby's) silhouette stood among unicorn fantasy
		colors.  Who are their clientele?  Lo-fi Instagram hipsters in film school or the America High Class of 1975?
<p>But i digress.
<p>When we arrived at our table, the hostess toppled the pepper shaker, leaving a little hillock of ground black peppercorn on table for the duration of the 
meal, daring me to sneeze.  Apart from this oversight, our server performed in outstanding fashion.  And they leave a bottle of water on the table, something
 every mildly formal seated restaurant should do.
<p>For round one we ordered malanga chips with tzatziki sauce.  The cooks had empowered this tzatziki with lime and chili.  Together, these created a potent 
combination.  i suspect they incorporated something more than plain yogurt—like sour cream or crème fraîche—which would account for its surplus tang.  They 
cut the malanga chips thicker and fried them longer than i have in my experience in kitchens.  That turned out to be a good thing.  Somehow those malanga 
chips make you compulsively eat one after another.
<p>I ordered the vegetable lasagna.  The dish that arrived consisted of stewed mushrooms and vegetables between three to four layers of spiced soft tofu 
co-starring with Fontina cheese topped with trumpet mushrooms structured rectangularly in a moat of pomodoro sauce.  So, like, the tofu was where the noodles 
were supposed to be.  Micro-cilantro offered a verdant contrast as garnish.  Now, making tofu flavorful is a Herculean task.  This lasagna was a tasty and 
original vegetarian dish.  Seeing a culinary team go out of their way to offer an uncommon option to the world's herbivores <em>that does not suck</em> is 
really really nice.  
<p>One of my companions ordered the salmon which came with a potato risotto.  The pork Ossobucco arrived with candied pears.  The team at Shelby is making 
food that makes you go "Huh, this is interesting."  They are re-purposing ingredients and well-loved dishes, inverting traditional expectations in Allentown, 
Pennsylvania.</p>

		<h2>Ambrosia Apples</h2>
		<h3>19/12/18</h3>
		<p>The Ambrosia apple is comparable to a gala.  Though softer, it still kept a healthy distance from the mealy McIntosh.  My particular specimen 
		became increasingly soft approaching one side.  Its flesh belies its appellation; sweetness and tartness were both low.</p>

		<h2>Dessert at A Rake's Progress</h2>
		<h3>by Chefs Amanda Cook and Beth Bosmeny</h3>
<h3>drinks by Corey Polyoka</h3>
<h3>11/12/18</h3>
<img src="lcrampton.github.io/20181211_212446.jpg" width="400px" align="right" alt="desserts on the board">
<p>A Rake's Progress, presumably named for the 18th century series of paintings by William Hogarth, nestles itself into the second floor of The Line, a hotel and gathering space built into a former church in Adams Morgan.  Organ pipes from the church's pipe organ compose the atrium's focal point like a live-action Windows 95 screensaver.  There are at least two other restaurants in the space, which gets confusing.  This is a deliberately swanky establishment.  Suffice it to say that The Muffin Man has some "gonnegtions" who arranged this evening.</p>
<p>i ordered off the mocktail menu a cider and a verjusade.  When i initially sipped the cider it tasted like it was pressed from Fuji (or Kiku) apples; it was super-sweet.  There is nothing like in-season apple cider, so it is hard to miss on this one.  My palette would have appreciated something to cut that sweetness, but i can also admire leaving the cider alone and letting it speak for itself.  The verjusade told a much different story.  The next time i see verjusade on a menu, i will order it.  What is verjusade?  Picture a sparkling lemonade with a shot of red wine, minus the alcohol.  The right amount of sparkle gave it a quaint bite, while the citrus granted tartness.  The sweetness level made it a true treat, and the verjus lent its bitter intrigue.  This is a well-executed mocktail.
<p>I ordered the tahini ice cream.  My gonnegtion ordered the pear cassis sorbet.  Nice.  These came with Lorna Doone-style shortbread cookies whose brittle butteryness complemented the frozen treats well.  We ordered these before i knew what was about to happen.
<p>Chef Cook treated my gonnegtion to a sample board from the pastry kitchen.  Here is what we received:</p>
<ul><li>two (2) oat bars with blackberry jam and a sesame brittle</li>
<li>a cranberry charlotte</li>
<li>a pear and cranberry galette</li>
<li>a s'mores bar</li>
</ul>

<p>The oat bar was my favorite.  Longtime acquaintances of Muffin Man Magookas will know that i particularly prefer dense to floofy desserts, and these 
delivered.  Like a naughty granola bar, the oat bar coyly resists initial attempts at mastication, but gooey jam belies its intention to be delightful. 
 Crème fraîche brings this item into the third dimension with its sour tang.  Sesame brittle elevates it with an intensely nutty counterpoint.
<p>The cranberry charlotte represented the most technically challenging item and largest flex on the board.  Its tartness challenges one's childish 
expectations of dessert and the subtlety of its eggnog mousse made me go back for more merely to decipher its content.  Three different front-of-house 
staff described it three different ways.  Like a gustatory rhetorical trap, it belittles one's intellect.
<p>The galette was a rather dry puff-pastry piece but boy when i put it in my ice cream...  A gander at the menu reveals that the team typically serves 
this with ice cream, so that is good.
<p>A graham crust, a chocolate sponge cake, a toasted honey meringue, shaved chocolate, and honey-graham crisps combine to form Rake's s'mores bar.  The cake 
leaves no cocoa at the door, hitting the bottom of one's nose with the bittersweet richness of black cocoa and, like, zero leavening (density makes a reprise).
  The s'mores bar's honey crisps lean in similarly hard, delivering honey-comb punch.  Strange then, that the team perched this atop the honey meringue across 
  from a rather uninspired shaving of chocolate.
<p>Overall, Cook and team display an advanced grasp of garnish and gustatory counterpoint.  I would love to experience the rest of the "real" menu if it 
applies these more consistently.  They stand in the middle ground between the avant-garde and familiar, twisting each dish with a little personal  flair.</p>

		<h2>Kiku Apples</h2>
		<h3>3/12/18</h3>
		<img src="lcrampton.github.io/Kiku Apple OC.jpg" width="400px" align="right" alt="A Kiku apple.  Photo by Lucas.">
		<p>These apples will recall memories of the familiar Fuji, the Kiku's relative known for its sweetness.  Its flesh will supply a satisfying, 
		cartoonish snap.  Each bite leaves a rich geologic fruitscape ripe for investigation.  Stripes on the Kiku's rather thin skin help it blend in 
		with surrounding Galas, but be not fooled.</p>
