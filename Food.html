		<h2>Dessert at A Rake's Progress</h2>

<p>A Rake's Progress, presumably named for the 18th century series of paintings by William Hogarth, nestles itself into the second floor of The Line, a hotel and gathering space built into a former church in Adams Morgan.  Organ pipes from the church's pipe organ compose the atrium's focal point like a live-action Windows 95 screensaver.  There are at least two other restaurants in the space, which gets confusing.  This is a deliberately swanky establishment.  Suffice it to say that The Muffin Man has some "gonnegtions" who arranged this evening.</p>
<p>i ordered off the mocktail menu a cider and a verjusade.  When i initially sipped the cider it tasted like it was pressed from Fuji (or Kiku) apples; it was super-sweet.  There is nothing like in-season apple cider, so it is hard to miss on this one.  My palette would have appreciated something to cut that sweetness, but i can also admire leaving the cider alone and letting it speak for itself.  The verjusade told a much different story.  The next time i see verjusade on a menu, i will order it.  What is verjusade?  Picture a sparkling lemonade with a shot of red wine, minus the alcohol.  The right amount of sparkle gave it a quaint bite, while the citrus granted tartness.  The sweetness level made it a true treat, and the verjus lent its bitter intrigue.  This is a well-executed mocktail.
<p>I ordered the tahini ice cream.  My gonnegtion ordered the pear cassis sorbet.  Nice.  These came with Lorna Doone-style shortbread cookies whose brittle butteryness complemented the frozen treats well.  We ordered these before i knew what was about to happen.
<p>Chef Cook treated my gonnegtion to a sample board from the pastry kitchen.  Here is what we received:</p>
<ul><li>two (2) oat bars with blackberry jam and a sesame brittle</li>
<li>a cranberry charlotte</li>
<li>a pear and cranberry galette</li>
<li>a s'mores bar</li>
</ul>

<p>The oat bar was my favorite.  Longtime acquaintances of Muffin Man Magookas will know that i particularly prefer dense to floofy desserts, and these delivered.  Like a naughty granola bar, the oat bar coyly resists initial attempts at mastication, but gooey jam belies its intention to be delightful.  Crème fraîche brings this item into the third dimension with its sour tang.  Sesame brittle elevates it with an intensely nutty counterpoint.
<p>The cranberry charlotte represented the most technically challenging item and largest flex on the board.  Its tartness challenges one's childish expectations of dessert and the subtlety of its eggnog mousse made me go back for more merely to decipher its content.  Three different front-of-house staff described it three different ways.  Like a gustatory rhetorical trap, it belittles one's intellect.
<p>The galette was a rather dry puff-pastry piece but boy when i put it in my ice cream...  A gander at the menu reveals that the team typically serves this with ice cream, so that is good.
<p>A graham crust, a chocolate sponge cake, a toasted honey meringue, shaved chocolate, and honey-graham crisps combine to form Rake's s'mores bar.  The cake leaves no cocoa at the door, hitting the bottom of one's nose with the bittersweet richness of black cocoa and, like, zero leavening (density makes a reprise).  The s'mores bar's honey crisps lean in similarly hard, delivering honey-comb punch.  Strange then, that the team perched this atop the honey meringue across from a rather uninspired shaving of chocolate.
<p>Overall, Cook and team display an advanced grasp of garnish and gustatory counterpoint.  I would love to experience the rest of the "real" menu if it applies these more consistently.  They stand in the middle ground between the avant-garde and familiar, twisting each dish with a little personal  flair.</p>

		<h2>Kiku Apples</h2>
		<h3>3/12/18</h3>
		<p>These apples will recall memories of the familiar Fuji, the Kiku's relative known for its sweetness.  Its flesh will supply a satisfying, 
		cartoonish snap.  Each bite leaves a rich geologic fruitscape ripe for investigation.  Stripes on the Kiku's rather thin skin help it blend in 
		with surrounding Galas, but be not fooled.</p>
