		<h2>Doi Moi Takeout</h2>
		<h3>13/2/21</h3>
		<p>It was restaurant week and the Super Bowl, so we balled out on some fancy Vietnamese food.&nbsp For appetizer round, i got the tangy Brussels sprouts.&nbsp My friends had the dumplings.&nbsp Two out of two hits.&nbsp</p>
		<p>My main course was the fun and saucy drunken noodle.&nbsp They used a noodle shape that was like, rhombuses.&nbsp The sauce was brown and a delicious cross of umami and sweet and spicy.&nbsp Mushrooms and okra added big chomp to noodle slurps.</p>
		<p>For dessert, Doi Moi served up sticky rice with mango and butterfly sauce.&nbsp What the heck is butterfly sauce?&nbsp It turns out to be basically runny blue frosting.&nbsp Though dessert was entirely too sweet for me, it opened my eyes to a world of sweet rice, which i will keep in mind.</p>

		<h2>Snap Dragon Apple</h2>
		<h3>17/12/20</h3>
		<p>They named this one correctly.&nbsp It is on par with the Fuji in crispyness, but not so sweet.&nbsp Finally, a version of the apple that meets my texture expectations without potentially rotting my teeth.&nbsp This apple rocks my socks.&nbsp It will not put pounds on you.&nbsp Rock on Chicago.</p>

		<h2>Evercrisp Apple</h2>
		<h3>14/3/20</h3>
		<img class="righta" src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/Evercrisp.jpg" style="transform:rotate(90deg)" width="300px" align="right" margin="20px" alt="an Evercrisp apple">
		<p>This aptly-named apple is tight as a rubber band.&nbsp Genuinely crispy and sweet, imagine if a Fuji went supersonic.&nbsp Evercrisp, like Evermore, Eversource Energy, Evernote, Everlane, Everclear, Everlasting Gobstoppers, et cetera, unabashedly evokes abundance.&nbsp This is the apple of post-scarcity times.&nbsp Or children short on pocket change.&nbsp One bite launches you into a loop of crunch limited only by your sample rate.&nbsp Like snare drums, the crisps generate potential energy in their absence (Shiva once <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Flesh-Bones-Collection-Writings/dp/0804831866">said</a>, while describing <em>Moksha</em>, "Or in the spaces between, feel this as lightning").</p>

		<h2>Sunday Brunch at The Smith</h2>
		<h3>16/2/20</h3>
		<p>It turns out that you get a <em>complimentary</em> brunch cocktail with some brunch entrées at The Smith.&nbsp I ordered the vanilla bean French toast.&nbsp The French toast was good, though it came with fostered bananas (too sweet for my morning), and i did not really taste the vanilla.&nbsp But that brioche, bro!&nbsp The Smith compensates for its train-station restroom decor with excellent service.</p>

		<h2>Nighttime Beverages at Tryst</h2>
		<h3>10/1/20</h3>
		<p>Tryst offers a solid alternative to bar-hopping on those Fridays that have you sliding face first into home.&nbsp Tryst comes close to the <em>Hygge</em> virtue, but refuses to sacrifice fire safety for coziness, opting for dim lighting over candles.&nbsp And its situation in the heart of Adams Morgan's nightlife attracts cathartic, celebratory energy on weekends.&nbsp Nevertheless, it offers a necessary oasis in a play-hard culture.</p>
		<p>I ordered the taro and beetroot latte with almond milk.&nbsp It reminded us of something.&nbsp Whether that something was Abuelita hot chocolate or mulled cider or <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/04/cacao-tejate-ancient-chocolate-drink/16609/">tejate</a></em>, i still do not know.&nbsp It was, in any case, deliciously earthen and interesting.&nbsp My companion ordered the rooibos tea.&nbsp Each arrived with a powerfully rich little butter cookie.</p>

		<h2>Dinner at HalfSmoke</h2>
		<h3>11/5/19</h3>
		<p>In the wake of the Funk Parade and a subsequent downpour, i bought my mother dinner at HalfSmoke.&nbsp HalfSmoke is the boardgame-laden sausage parlour and YoPro haven on the corner of Florida and seventh street (Chuck Brown Way).&nbsp They have a bratwurst called "Bustin' Loose."  Is this homage or swagger-jacking?&nbsp Discuss.
		<p>The front of house lacked any sense of urgency, but they sort of make up for it by leaving a bottle of water on the table, which checks a box for me.
		<p>They boil the rice real lightly at HalfSmoke, so bring your <em>dente</em> if you plan to order grains.&nbsp The menu at HalfSmoke does not explicitly limit the number of toppings you can order.&nbsp That works to the advantage of people who feel no sense of shame or empathy and want to order every vegetable topping.&nbsp I really should have gotten more sauce, too.
		<p>At HalfSmoke, where Video Home System tape cases contain your checks and Trapper Keepers<sup>®</sup> bind the menus, where Jay-Z and Janet Jackson play on mounted flatscreens, it is always your primetime—the nineties.</p>

		<h2>Dinner at Sakuramen</h2>
		<h3>31/3/19</h3>
		<p>Sakuramen made me ask, "Do we only review good places?" and answer: No.&nbsp 
		<p>Sakuramen redeems its faults right out the gate with excellent service from handsome and amiable young men.&nbsp Their meals reach heights of umami seldom seen in this hemisphere.&nbsp And they stock good kimchi (put it in the broth, y'all).
		<p>Ramen is noodles in broth.&nbsp Broth and noodles are critical to ramen.&nbsp The pork broth is fatty but otherwise unremarkable.&nbsp The sakuramen (vegetable) broth is actually pretty dope once the kimchi dives in there.&nbsp The staff will encourage you to order extra toppings, and i will second that if you are after a fuller-bodied broth.&nbsp But the price will add up quickly.&nbsp In the noodle department, Sakuramen goes soft.&nbsp Understanding that ramen is noodles in broth, we still believe one could cook these noodles less.&nbsp <em>It is our dente and we want it now!</em>
		<p>I led the way to A Rake's Progress for dessert, belching umami belches with uncommon frequency.</p>

		<h2>Fourth Meal at Annie's Paramount Steakhouse</h2>
		<h3>31/3/19</h3>
		<img class="lefta" src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/Lucas at Annie's.jpg" width="300px" align="left" margin="20px" alt="Lucas at Annie's">
		<p>After hours of shimmying, swaying, popping, and locking, you are exhausted from hip to toe, and the profound hunger unique to the wee hours takes hold.&nbsp You shuffle eastward, without aim, as last calls punt revelers onto the </*ten-yard lines of the */>sidewalks.&nbsp As you pass shuttered establishments, you hear murmurs of a rumor of a legend.&nbsp Who is serving food to the weary of this night post-mortem?
		<p>Annie's is.
		<p>Annie's Paramount Steakhouse (not strictly a steakhouse, but <em>paramount</em> to one, i suppose) is that storied mecca of hospitality.&nbsp At the beginning of this year, the James Beard Foundation named Annie's an American Classic.&nbsp This is also the year of their seventy-fifth anniversary!&nbsp Annie's, in her enduring grace, opens its doors for twenty-four hours on weekends.&nbsp Now, why is DC so utterly devoid of such places?&nbsp What is so wrong with this city?&nbsp <span style="font-size:7px">It probably goes back to the height ordinance, but whatever.</span>
		<p>Of course, anybody could remain open all night.&nbsp But Annie's delivers quality diner grub, and that is what makes it a destination, not just a fancy 7-Eleven.&nbsp The employees of Annie's are missionaries; we are their flock.&nbsp They cut their fries wide and fry them hot so they are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.&nbsp We can rest our weary heads there on the potato pillow.&nbsp They sautè mushrooms with care and slather them on the garden burger under ripe avocado.&nbsp Annie's food finds your nocturnal hunger pangs and knocks them the fuck out.
		<p>One dedicated waiter ran the whole packed floor that night.&nbsp Heroes wear aprons.&nbsp We tipped probably more than i ever have, except this one time at Red Robin...but i digress.&nbsp That guy has a job if i ever open my restaurant.
		<p>We sat beside Rubin and Freddie, who are, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ld65BZzPrnY?t=199">you know, <em>sisters</em></a>.&nbsp In the convivial, high-decibel atmosphere, it felt natural to converse with them.&nbsp But i started to wonder, out of statistical curiosity, why—and this is not to brag—so many dudes here were hitting on me.&nbsp We looked outside.&nbsp Lampposts bore the rainbow flag.&nbsp A banner of little pride flags decorated the threshold of a Subway<sup>®</sup>.&nbsp Men were kissing men.&nbsp Women gazed deeply into the eyes of women.&nbsp Welcome to the gayborhood!&nbsp According to histories of DC, the LGBT community, cast out of mainstream society, moved into Logan Circle after the riots in the late sixties when property values were low and renovated the neighborhood.&nbsp They deserve this nice thing.</p>

		<h2>Lunch at Falafel Inc</h2>
		<h3>3/2/19</h3>
		<p>Falafel Inc's falafel ballas are light and fluffy.&nbsp The ingredients are ground and chopped finely, indicating the use of appliances.&nbsp These balls stood in opposition to the Amsterdam Falafel philosophy of falafel (falasophy?).&nbsp The falafel's supporting cast included red cabbage, hummus, pickles, and lettuce.&nbsp This was actually a quite straightforward sandwich, but nicely executed.&nbsp 
		<p>Falafel Inc. rejects mod interior design, opting to bare their oriented strand board on the walls and ceiling.&nbsp Other fast-casual spots erect a wall between payments and kitchen areas.&nbsp Here, the register is embedded in the assembly line.&nbsp The deep belly of the kitchen—where fryers bubble and heavy machinery turns—lies in full view beyond the counter.&nbsp Their equivalent of tickets ringing in is the cashier leaning to the girl next to her and saying "two."
		<p>At four dollars, the sandwiches are <em>radically</em> inexpensive for Georgetown.&nbsp And a portion of Falafel Inc's revenue provides meals for refugees.&nbsp Humanitarianism and cuisine have always had intertwined values.&nbsp This facet of the Falafel Inc experience makes it more enjoyable, more significant, and more repeatable.&nbsp I hope they withstand the other falafel spots in their proximity.
		<p>Falafel, the jewel of the Levant, potentially breeds division or concordance, depending on context.&nbsp Falafel Inc deploys the fried goodies to sow peace.

		<h2>Piñata Apple</h2>
		<h3>19/1/19</h3>
		<p>This may be the tangiest apple i have encountered.&nbsp Its sourness could complement a crumble or a caramel sauce dip.&nbsp Its core has a high structural integrity.&nbsp O Piñata, are you a Granny Smith in disguise?&nbsp Please do not catfish my palette.</p>

		<h2>Dinner at The Shelby</p>
		<h3>20/12/18</h3>
		<img class="righta" src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/The Shelby Malanga Chips.jpg" width="200px" align="right" alt="malanga chips">
		<img class="righta" src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/The Shelby Lasagna.jpg" width="200px" align="right" alt="vegetable lasagna">
		<p>i have to take issue with the interior design at this establishment.&nbsp I considered taking a stand on only discussing the food but fuck it, this is 
		the Muffin Man Magookas eating experience blog; we do what we want!&nbsp A wall of pictures from the seventies flanked our table.&nbsp My heart sank a little 
		because this made me feel a little Ruby Tuesdayish.&nbsp Beyond my companion's head somebody had mounted a long mirror horizontally, so that i could 
		surveil other patrons and their dishes.&nbsp Above the mirror, a massive print of a woman's (presumably Shelby's) silhouette stood among unicorn fantasy
		colors.&nbsp Who are their clientele?&nbsp Lo-fi Instagram hipsters in film school or the America High Class of 1975?
		<p>But i digress.
		<p>When we arrived at our table, the hostess toppled the pepper shaker, leaving a little hillock of ground black peppercorn on table for the duration of the meal, daring me to sneeze.&nbsp Apart from this oversight, our server performed in outstanding fashion.&nbsp And they leave a bottle of water on the table, something every mildly formal seated restaurant should do.
		<p>For round one we ordered malanga chips with tzatziki sauce.&nbsp The cooks had empowered this tzatziki with lime and chili.&nbsp Together, these created a potent combination.&nbsp I suspect they incorporated something more than plain yogurt—like sour cream or crème fraîche—which would account for its surplus tang.&nbsp They cut the malanga chips thicker and fried them longer than i have in my experience in kitchens.&nbsp That turned out to be a good thing.&nbsp Somehow those malanga chips make you compulsively eat one after another.
		<p>I ordered the vegetable lasagna.&nbsp The dish that arrived consisted of stewed mushrooms and vegetables between three to four layers of spiced soft tofu co-starring with Fontina cheese topped with trumpet mushrooms structured rectangularly in a moat of pomodoro sauce.&nbsp So, like, the tofu was where the noodles were supposed to be.&nbsp Micro-cilantro offered a verdant contrast as garnish.&nbsp Now, making tofu flavorful is a Herculean task.&nbsp This lasagna was a tasty and original vegetarian dish.&nbsp Seeing a culinary team go out of their way to offer an uncommon option to the world's herbivores <em>that does not suck</em> is really really nice.&nbsp 
		<p>One of my companions ordered the salmon which came with a potato risotto.&nbsp The pork Ossobucco arrived with candied pears.&nbsp The team at Shelby is making food that makes you go "Huh, this is interesting."  They are re-purposing ingredients and well-loved dishes, inverting traditional expectations in Allentown, Pennsylvania.</p>

		<h2>Ambrosia Apples</h2>
		<h3>19/12/18</h3>
		<p>The Ambrosia apple is comparable to a gala.&nbsp Though softer, it still kept a healthy distance from the mealy McIntosh.&nbsp My particular specimen 
		became increasingly soft approaching one side.&nbsp Its flesh belies its appellation; sweetness and tartness were both low.</p>

		<h2>Dessert at A Rake's Progress</h2>
		<h3>by Chefs Amanda Cook and Beth Bosmeny</h3>
		<h3>drinks by Corey Polyoka</h3>
		<h3>11/12/18</h3>
		<img class="righta" src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/Rake Dessert.jpg" width="400px" align="right" alt="desserts on the board">
		<p>A Rake's Progress, presumably named for the 18th century series of paintings by William Hogarth, nestles itself into the second floor of The Line, a hotel and gathering space built into a former church in Adams Morgan.&nbsp Organ pipes from the church's pipe organ compose the atrium's focal point like a live-action Windows 95 screensaver.&nbsp There are at least two other restaurants in the space, which gets confusing.&nbsp This is a deliberately swanky establishment.&nbsp Suffice it to say that The Muffin Man has some "gonnegtions" who arranged this evening.</p>
		<p>i ordered off the mocktail menu a cider and a verjusade.&nbsp When i initially sipped the cider it tasted like it was pressed from Fuji (or Kiku) apples; it was super-sweet.&nbsp There is nothing like in-season apple cider, so it is hard to miss on this one.&nbsp My palette would have appreciated something to cut that sweetness, but i can also admire leaving the cider alone and letting it speak for itself.&nbsp The verjusade told a much different story.&nbsp The next time i see verjusade on a menu, i will order it.&nbsp What is verjusade?&nbsp Picture a sparkling lemonade with a shot of red wine, minus the alcohol.&nbsp The right amount of sparkle gave it a quaint bite, while the citrus granted tartness.&nbsp The sweetness level made it a true treat, and the verjus lent its bitter intrigue.&nbsp This is a well-executed mocktail.
		<p>I ordered the tahini ice cream.&nbsp My gonnegtion ordered the pear cassis sorbet.&nbsp Nice.&nbsp These came with Lorna Doone-style shortbread cookies whose brittle butteryness complemented the frozen treats well.&nbsp We ordered these before i knew what was about to happen.
		<p>Chef Cook treated my gonnegtion to a sample board from the pastry kitchen.&nbsp Here is what we received:</p>
		<ul><li>two (2) oat bars with blackberry jam and a sesame brittle</li>
		<li>a cranberry charlotte</li>
		<li>a pear and cranberry galette</li>
		<li>a s'mores bar</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The oat bar was my favorite.&nbsp Longtime acquaintances of Muffin Man Magookas will know that i particularly prefer dense to floofy desserts, and these delivered.&nbsp Like a <strong>naughty granola bar</strong>, the oat bar coyly resists initial attempts at mastication, but gooey jam belies its intention to be delightful. Crème fraîche brings this item into the third dimension with its sour tang.&nbsp Sesame brittle elevates it with an intensely nutty counterpoint.
		<p>The cranberry charlotte represented the most technically challenging item and largest flex on the board.&nbsp Its tartness challenges one's childish 
		expectations of dessert and the subtlety of its eggnog mousse made me go back for more merely to decipher its content.&nbsp Three different front-of-house 
		staff described it three different ways.&nbsp Like a gustatory rhetorical trap, it belittles one's intellect.
		<p>The galette was a rather dry puff-pastry piece but boy when i put it in my ice cream...&nbsp A gander at the menu reveals that the team typically serves 
		this with ice cream, so that is good.
		<p>A graham crust, a chocolate sponge cake, a toasted honey meringue, shaved chocolate, and honey-graham crisps combine to form Rake's s'mores bar.&nbsp The cake leaves no cocoa at the door, hitting the bottom of one's nose with the bittersweet richness of black cocoa and, like, zero leavening (density makes a reprise).&nbsp The s'mores bar's honey crisps lean in similarly hard, delivering honey-comb punch.&nbsp Strange then, that the team perched this atop the honey meringue across from a rather uninspired shaving of chocolate.
		<p>Overall, Cook and team display an advanced grasp of garnish and gustatory counterpoint.&nbsp I would love to experience the rest of the "real" menu if it applies these more consistently.&nbsp They stand in the middle ground between the avant-garde and familiar, twisting each dish with a little personal  flair.</p>

		<h2>Kiku Apples</h2>
		<h3>3/12/18</h3>
		<img class="righta" src="lcrampton.github.io/Github_Images/Kiku Apple OC.jpg" width="400px" align="right" alt="A Kiku apple.&nbsp Photo by Lucas.">
		<p>These apples will recall memories of the familiar Fuji, the Kiku's relative known for its sweetness.&nbsp Its flesh will supply a satisfying, 
		cartoonish snap.&nbsp Each bite leaves a rich geologic fruitscape ripe for investigation.&nbsp Stripes on the Kiku's rather thin skin help it blend in 
		with surrounding Galas, but be not fooled.</p>
