				<figcaption class="leftFigCaption">Gruff and John Evans<figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>As a result of an otherwise engaged coworker's courtesy (shouts out), i had the privilege of seeing a jetlagged and very Welsh Gruff Rhys perform his <i>American Interior</i> project.</p>
		<p>Le Poisson Rouge had the tables out for this one.&nbsp That was not at all the case when i saw Xiu Xiu and YHWH Nailgun there in the fall.&nbsp But tables fit the bill on this night.&nbsp I would admit that the pace of things required some patience, but i have patience.</p>
		<p>The show slalomed from lecture to comedy to music, taking its time, pausing for effect, doubling back to check on facts.&nbsp It is the Gruff Rhys one man show or guest lecture in a kooky elective course.&nbsp And we all learned a lot.&nbsp Theories of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic encounters really get me in the mood.&nbsp My night culminated in several tabs open to Wikipedia articles.</p>
		<p>Gruff sounds solid.&nbsp He is not a standout vocalist or a virtuosic guitarist, but his songwriting contains something compelling—at least to me.&nbsp It could be that i have no objective argument in his favor, but we see the world in similar ways, and therefore connect on its lyrical representation.
		 </p>
		<p>He played most of the <i>American Interior</i> album, but also played "Bad Friend," the leading track from his 2024 album.&nbsp Why is he touring <i>American Interior</i> at this time, on its twelfth anniversary and on the heels of a new project?&nbsp I have no idea.&nbsp Early on in the show, though, he shared that it is a difficult project to explain.&nbsp I would imagine so.&nbsp It is a good reminder to me that not every piece of art has to tackle great existential quandaries.&nbsp Inspiration can find us amid esoterica.

				<figcaption class="leftFigCaption">nice lights</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>There is an obscene artificiality to the field of lights.&nbsp Munro probably intended this.&nbsp Lights are often the very mark of the artificial; it contrasts with the notion and pastoral connotation of "field."&nbsp So there is a contradiction here, but is it worth it?</p>
		<p>I am not sure why there is a three-block parcel of fallow land adjacent to the United Nations.&nbsp Does the city reserve it for art installations?&nbsp Munro planted the original iteration of Field of Light in Uluru, Northern Territories, Australia, which has a lot more open space.&nbsp In the context of Murray Hill (Tudor City?&nbsp Midtown East?), it seems a bit of a monument to poor land use.</p>
		<p>The lights themselves look coolest when the light-emitting diode strips form a sort of web shape.&nbsp But this seems almost accidental.&nbsp The ensemble looks more pleasing when you are in it at ground level than from above.&nbsp It kind of grows on you as you meander.&nbsp Grows.&nbsp Like a <em>field</em>.&nbsp Plants and grasses and shrubs are growing in here, too.&nbsp Which clearly requires some management.&nbsp Aesthetically, they provide the negative space.&nbsp The clamor of the city continues, puncturing the sense of enclosure.</p>
		<p>This must have been a lot of work—planting a field.&nbsp Of light.&nbsp I am partial to <em>works</em> of art.&nbsp I find that in modern, conceptual, and installation art, the process can express as much as the product.</p>
		<p>Lit windows in the city's edifice visually extend the field on the vertical axis.&nbsp Lights illuminate the path, but i wish they were not there.&nbsp They outshine the installation a bit.&nbsp I suppose they must be there for safety, but in that case, i wish it were more dangerous.&nbsp Remove the guards standing by emergency exits and remove the lone fire extinguisher (presumably for the inevitable brushfire).&nbsp Let a minotaur loose.&nbsp Make it interactive.</p>

			</figure>
		<p>Cavalier from the Backwoodz label opened.&nbsp At first, my attitude was "Who is this guy, heh?"&nbsp But he won me over; he was kind of funny.</p>
		<p>The troposphere was stewing us in a swampy pre-storm broth, but Armand Hammer fought through it with breath control, Kenny Segal beats, towels, and bottled water.&nbsp People knew their lyrics.&nbsp In fact, they seemed to know the collab album better than the solo works.</p>
		<p>Elucid is a unit of a man, and his voice reverberates off his body in a baritone resonance.&nbsp billy woods seems like an intense guy when performing.&nbsp He strikes me as one of those people with whom i likely <em>agree</em> on most socio-political matters, but also is so heavily principled (burdened by integrity?) that he can see entire personages in a glance and wastes no patience on naïveté.&nbsp I was a little afraid to make eye contact.&nbsp  He makes some jokes though, which cut the tension.&nbsp 
		<p>Hip hop seems stale to me lately, but woods is one of the few contemporary hip hop artists i still listen to and trust to deliver quality.&nbsp I like his style, and i find he is improving.&nbsp I found myself nodding during the show, and not to the beat, but in agreement.</p>

		<h3>12/6/23</h3>
			<p>In the age of streaming and zoomers with squirrely attention spans, i fear we are missing the joy of serendipity.&nbsp I do not mourn the loss of channel surfing, but there is something more rewarding about hearing good stuff on the radio.&nbsp When someone else is curating, i find there is a lower threshold for goodness.&nbsp I have more patience for tracks from Boiler Room sets than those on my own playlists.&nbsp Maybe my expectations are lower.&nbsp Maybe like one cannot physically tickle oneself, i struggle to tickle my own fancy.</p>
			<p>And maybe a good selector never reveals the secret to the selection, but <a href="http://survivingtheworld.net/Lesson670.html">sharing</a> seems more important.&nbsp My secrets are obsolete anyway.&nbsp I am zipping down the road, you can chew on this—my dust.</p>
			<p>So in that spirit, here are five of my favorite finds on <a href="http://radio.garden/">radio.garden</a>.</p>

			<button class="accordion">Yabiladi</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<iframe src="https://www.yabiladi.com/radio/lecteur/1/radio-yabiladi.html" width="50%" height="300px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
					<p>Somebody got me to listen to the Master Musicians of Jajouka.&nbsp Nothing was ever the same.</p>
					<p>Yabiladi runs two stations that appear on radio.garden: Yabiladi Radio, which at last listen was playing Arabic-language hip-hop, and Yabiladi Azawan Amazigh, which was playing folk music.&nbsp I tend to prefer Azawan Amazigh, but i still mix them up.</p>
					<p>Moroccan folk music has this amorphous liquidity to it that makes it good music for working.&nbsp I would not claim that Yabiladi is the best place for it, but i have certainly pulled some tracks from their playlist for my own pleasure.</p>
				</div>

			<button class="accordion">La Confiserie Sonore</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<iframe src="https://player.laconfiseriesonore.com/" width="50%" height="500px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
					<p>Sometimes you go looking for one thing and find a different thing which is also good.&nbsp While looking for Moroccan stations to quench my Jajouka thirst, i stumbled upon a nocturnal deep house outfit out of Marrakesh.&nbsp From 1800 to 0600 West Africa Time, they rotate ice cold, pulsing tracks through the vault, the blast chiller, and the airwaves.</p>
					<p>There are really no commercials to speak of, but they do have a rich robotic punch-up that tries to pronounce the name of the station.</p>
					<p>I have a playlist for concentration loaded with songs i do not recognize because i heard them once on La Confiserie Sonore and threw them right into the mix.</p>
				</div>
				
			<button class="accordion">Datafruits</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<iframe src="https://www.datafruits.fm/" width="50%" height="300px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
					<p>Datafruits seems to be a collective of geographically-dispersed DJs broadcasting out of Seattle that platforms a chaotic style of DJing that i really respect.&nbsp It is also a <a href="https://datafruits.bandcamp.com/">record label</a>?&nbsp They are not trying to please anyone; they are pushing boundaries.&nbsp When almost everything seems to be worn out, datafruits reaches higher to scratch the ultimate itch.</p>
					<p>Shiva, The Dancer, creates through destruction.&nbsp Likewise, Datafruits sublimates the anxious noise in my head, allowing me to focus.&nbsp Focus is the wrong term, but i find myself able to think.&nbsp And maybe those thoughts are all norepinephrine-derived, but they are thoughts nonetheless.&nbsp It tunes me to a modern, frenetic energy.</p>
				</div>
				
			<button class="accordion">Brokenbeats</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<iframe src="https://brokenbeats.net/" width="50%" height="275px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
					<p>Brokenbeats broadcasts nonstop breakbeat heaters out of Odesa, Ukraine.&nbsp Tune in when you need something to keep you awake and going during study sessions.</p>
					<p>Listening currently, i heard a punch-up that described their music as "atmospheric drum and bass," which sounds right, but the term "drum and bass" makes me a little suspicious.</p>
					<p>The <a href="https://brokenbeats.net/">chat</a> is sometimes lively and probably always unmoderated.&nbsp One time the host asked me about my favored streaming format and, uneducated, i was like ".wav?" and he let me know immediately that waveform is not a streaming standard.&nbsp I suppose if you dance with flame you should be ready to get roasted.</p>
				</div>
				
			<button class="accordion">WMUH</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<iframe src="https://wmuh.org/wmuh-player/" width="50%" height="330px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
					<p>No discussion of radio is complete without 91.7 WMUH Allentown, the only station that matters.&nbsp WMUH raised me over radio waves.&nbsp Its power was too raw, too eclectic to ignore.&nbsp I never stood a chance.&nbsp From Radiowave Distortion to Latin Sunday to Gutbucket Esoterica to the Jhankaar Program (Saturdays, 0800-1000), WMUH offers a solid introductory course in musicology.</p>
					<p>I think i have probably <a href="https://lcrampton.github.io/Culture.html#AcidDad">mentioned it before</a>.</p>

				<figcaption class="rightFigCaption">Cat Barb</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>To find a Caterina Barbieri concert, follow the girls in leather trenchcoats, the bob cuts, and the twink in chainmail.</p>
		<p>I arrived during Eli Keszler's set.&nbsp I did not recognize the name, but it turns out that I actually saw him performing his ambient diddly-bops at an arts festival in 2018.&nbsp He fit the vibe alright.&nbsp But his dense percussion bounced rambunctiously around the cavernous venue.&nbsp Some had overlooked the David Byrne <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_Music_Works/fLGVDgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA13&printsec=frontcover">theory of matching spaces and sounds</a>.</p>
		<p>Caterina appeared twice to ready her gear, but she did not really <em>appear</em> until she emerged on a bed of fog with a bionic arm equipped.&nbsp It matched the chains dangling from her platform heels.&nbsp Despite the getup, she comes off more nerdy in person than the sulking mysterious artist image i had internalized.&nbsp But then, who else composes on a modular synthesizer and performs in arthouses?&nbsp This is nerd stuff.&nbsp Nerds rule. 🖖</p>
		<p>They filled that warehouse with more fog at once than i have ever seen in my life.&nbsp At times, i could not see the people in front of me.&nbsp But it did create a canvas full of opportunity to make the visuals impressive.&nbsp Caterina could have appeared and disappeared like a ninja.</p>
		<p>This show was moving; it was one of the best performances i have ever seen.&nbsp Time to rethink my top three.&nbsp But of course it was that good.&nbsp I may have <a href=#Teens>said before</a> that Barbieri's music, despite its electronic textures, is deeply emotional.&nbsp The way her snowball of sound grows like a fugue into an acoustic avalanche left me sweating, mouth agape.&nbsp <i>Oh god.&nbsp We are so small.</i>&nbsp What is usually a weakness in electronica counts among her strengths.&nbsp I was trying to be present, and trying to cry—and getting close—but i could not quite get there.&nbsp I felt too perceived.&nbsp <span class="whisper">Maybe, like reaching climax, crying is close to impossible on this much escitalopram.</span>&nbsp She kept weaving in the melodic motif from "<a href="https://youtu.be/0Olm9nsQgNw">SOTRS</a>."&nbsp Everything was familiar but fresh and raw and slightly improvised by virtue of the analog performance.</p>
		<p>Marie Davidson was a good time in the way a fan of her band's music might expect.&nbsp She started sparse and weird, and built her set to a darkly burning intensity.&nbsp The crowd that was densely immobile for Barbieri mostly drained out to leave a lot of room for relaxed bodily expression.&nbsp I even danced briefly with a stranger.</p>

		<h3>11/2/23</h3>

				<figcaption class="leftFigCaption">pensive Desna plays healing frequencies</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>The Pan-Pot show coincided with a fetish party.&nbsp I got in line and was a little surprised when somebody unzipped to show their strategic stickers.&nbsp But would we put it past a Berlin-based techno duo?&nbsp No, we would not.&nbsp The couple ahead of me in line felt overdressed; if they were overdressed, i was the Pope in the octagon.&nbsp "Fetish attire only" would make the night interesting.&nbsp Nonetheless, i knew i was in the right place, but i was pretty sure i was in the wrong line.&nbsp I chose to stick around for a little, maybe for anthropological research, maybe to gather intelligence <strong>for a friend</strong>.</p>
		<p>As it turned out, Pan-Pot were upstairs and the fetish party was downstairs.</p>
		<p>Desna sounded good.&nbsp Up there with Amelie Lens and Sama' Abdulhadi delivering trance that builds consistently enough to carry the room.&nbsp I was probably not as intoxicated as the music calls for, but i had a good time.&nbsp She was playing when i arrived and played for about three hours.</p>
			<figure class="leftFigure">
				<img class="badShadow"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lcrampton/lcrampton.github.io/master/Github_Images/Octave%20One%20at%20Knockdown%20Center.jpg"  width="325px" alt="Octave One high on stage, backlit with white beams of light">
				<figcaption class="leftFigCaption">Octave One burn it down</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>Octave One appeared backed by a buoyant white light, like biblically inaccurate angels, or like a Close Encounter.&nbsp I had seen them online in their massive <a href="https://youtu.be/XW6lxLUBu64?t=33">Moscow Boiler Room set</a>, and in pictures, but i was still startled by how much they simultaneously look like themselves and like deities of electronica.&nbsp Their music came on hard and fast, true to Detroit techno.&nbsp They played some of their hits—Blackwater, Afterglow—and i lost my mind.&nbsp It would have been fine if they did not play the hits.&nbsp It was <em>enough</em> to see them, but it was <em>divine</em> to hear the hits recombined and remixed live—crunchier, faster, bassier, or choppier.</p>
		<p>I had planned to probably leave once Pan-Pot began, but something fixed me in place.&nbsp They are no Octave One, but they were hitting the right notes.&nbsp I had transcended the lack of water, lack of sleep, and lack of drugs.&nbsp I was locked in, lost to dance.</p>

		<p>Finally, we saw him.&nbsp We saw Jonathan Richman in the flesh.&nbsp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hMAHqp9FNw">He does exist</a>.&nbsp But he has better gifts than Santa.&nbsp He offers a whole wholesome outlook on life.&nbsp From the first warm strums, he invites you to serenity.</p>
		<p>Without spoiling the setlist, i think i can say that Jonathan did not play all your favorites.&nbsp But i anticipated as much, and since i trust him as a songwriter, i knew i would be able to enjoy any combination of his content.&nbsp He can play whatever he wants; i am there for the Jonathan Richman experience.&nbsp One person requested "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3fZ8iEYN1g3duMfDThM42r?si=a3e855c5538742ac">When Harpo Played His Harp</a>," (a good request) and Jonathan obliged.</p>
		<p>Richman's nylon-string guitar sounded melliferous and saintly in that reverent environment.&nbsp At the outset of the show, he wandered the church, exploring its acoustics.&nbsp Throughout, Tommy Larkins leaned back with the drums, adding but never taking.</p>
		<p>The crowd seemed older in aggregate than the average American.&nbsp Perhaps Richman's show attracts a certain kind of person who thinks they are special.&nbsp <span class="whisper">There was an annoying couple next to me.&nbsp He liked to double clap.&nbsp He <em>really</em> liked to double clap.&nbsp The man in front of him must have turned around, because i noticed a commotion in which the subject of my chagrin poked the man in front of him and asked "What, you don't like it?" and his girlfriend had to ask him to stop.&nbsp Later she even interposed with her hands.&nbsp Why would you go to such a concert and make yourself a problem?</span></p>
		<p>Jonathan regaled us with banter about his music and touring life.&nbsp He even told a joke or two.&nbsp Sometimes when musicians do that it is bad and not funny, but this banter was good and funny.&nbsp One could describe the rest of my night as frustrating, but Jonathan's wholesome force overpowered it all.</p>

		<p>Elton John put on a fantastic show, but of course he did.		</p>
		<p>Costumed and feathery folks smiled and sauntered through the stadium and surroundings.&nbsp I felt the same expressive freedom and sense of ease one feels at a pride parade.&nbsp It is okay to be yourself here.		</p>
		<p>Often, i bring a record sleeve to try to get the artist to sign, but in the case of Elton John, i uh, <span class="whisper">already have that</span>.&nbsp So i had nothing to fret over, and only had to focus on enjoying the show.</p>
		<p>Mister John, for his part, still rocks like a crocodile, working the crowd, slamming the lid of the piano, getting lost in the music.&nbsp He played all the hits: the big ones that come to mind, your favorite song of his, the hits you forgot were his hits, and his new hit with Dua Lipa.&nbsp It takes a while for a legend to play through all those hits, and it was a long concert, though it never wavered nor lost momentum, even amongst two costume changes (he appeared in a bathrobe to close the set).</p>
		<p>What a guy, that Elton!</p>

		<p>More than a concert, seeing TC is an experience.&nbsp I felt the healing power of music.&nbsp My eyes welled up.&nbsp Maybe i am simply nostalgic for the <a href=#TC>youth i once had</a>.&nbsp I seemed the most psyched in the room for "Toyota Corolla", their eponymous track.&nbsp I must be becoming an old head.&nbsp The TC Superstar fandom feels like a community—like an in-group.&nbsp It was a girl in the crowd's birthday, and she birthday-requested "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4iDWKkgeeHJWK1AKf9iyGj?si=440f08fca66b4d51">Closer</a>," which was evidently not on the setlist this tour.&nbsp But they figured it out, and performed it anyway.&nbsp How nice!

				<figcaption class="rightFigCaption">Sleaford Mods wobble wobble wobble</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>Sorry is a sweet rock band.&nbsp I was worried we were going to get boring indie rock after the first song, but they executed well enough.&nbsp Marco, evidently added to the band last, dabbles in keys, samples, and an SP88 situation.&nbsp I could tell that these effects were getting muddied and somewhat lost in the space.&nbsp It can be really difficult to translate a busy sound from the studio to a small live setting, and Sorry should feel proud.&nbsp Opening acts always face an uphill battle, but this one, with its tender vocals and sliced riffs, was able to get me bobbing my head.&nbsp They introduced themselves saying, "Hi everyone we're Sorry."&nbsp <em>Aha</em>.
		</p>
		<p>So we finally saw Sleaford Mods, who we have mentioned <a href=#Teens>previously</a> and talked up to acquaintances since 2017's English Tapas.&nbsp The Mods seemed to enjoy themselves at their packed show at Philadelphia's Foundry.&nbsp Andrew (<a href="https://extnddntwrk.bandcamp.com/">extnddntwrk</a>) surprised many of us with his outgoing disposition and flailing limbs; i had anticipated stationary head-nods.&nbsp Jason shuffled and slid about and had some fun words for the crowd.&nbsp Highlights include "You know the words!" and "Philadelphia—you have a lot of energy!"&nbsp He promised to return and run up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, over-eager tourist vibes be damned.
		</p>
		<p>This Philadelphia crowd had surprisingly good energy.&nbsp This was the show at which i became the most soaked in beverages.&nbsp Someone lost a lot of their clear cocktail to the side of my head and leg.&nbsp My elbow went into somebody's head, and somebody's bone sailed into mine.&nbsp Sorry came around from backstage to mingle with the hoi polloi, and at some point Asha (lead vocals) must have noticed me jumping because she grabbed me by the belt and hurled me into the pit.&nbsp We stan a queen.&nbsp A girl in the moshpit who knew many of the lyrics screamed at me that i knew all the lyrics—a magical moment.&nbsp Yeah, my neck is sore.
		</p>
		<p>They did not play my favorite track, "<a href="https://genius.com/Sleaford-mods-under-the-plastic-and-nct-lyrics">Under the Plastic and NCT</a>," but that did not surprise me.&nbsp The setlist dipped into some aged back-catalog ("Tiswas", "Jolly Fucker"), which got at least a few people excited.&nbsp Perhaps—and this is speculative—there are seasoned and new Sleaford Mods fans, and everybody has a favorite album, which is equally likely to be any of their works.&nbsp The couple behind me sounded excited to hear "Elocution."&nbsp  Indeed, the <i>Spare Ribs</i> single cuts seemed to please the most, though some of the lowlights off the new album did not really land (looking at you, "Top Room").&nbsp The consistency of their work and steady growth of their international fanbase must make it difficult to build a setlist that works everywhere.
		</p>
		<p>So are they worth seeing live?&nbsp I could entertain the argument that their live sound does not differ terribly from recordings; they pipe in their beats, after all.&nbsp But they are syncretic, unique, and caustic enough to filter out the closed-minded from their body of attendees.&nbsp Earnest attendees are bound to find like-minded people, and that is true of any show, but the makeup of Sleaford Mods' American fanbase remains a mystery to me.&nbsp How and where do these people hear about Sleaford Mods, the punk hip-hip duo from Nottingham?&nbsp Probably, the Internet.&nbsp Like me, they are likely people who enjoy music broadly to begin with, discover the Mods, and fall deeply for their urban, post-industrial vibe.&nbsp It is not for everyone.&nbsp So i would advise that they are worth seeing if you already know and enjoy Sleaford Mods.&nbsp You may otherwise feel lost.
		</p>
		<p class="whisper">They declined to sign the vinyl that i gripped dearly amid sloshing bodies throughout the show, but they do not have to sign anything if they do not want to.&nbsp It is fine.&nbsp My heart is not broken; i am not despondent, nor miffed, nor bitter.&nbsp Get them next time, buddy.&nbsp Or get over it.

		<p>WMUH—the only station that matters—invited <a href="https://aciddad666.com/">Acid Dad</a> from Brooklyn and <a href="https://catatonicsuns.com/">Catatonic Suns</a> of Allentown to rock the Seeger student union.
		</p>
		<p>So this is what a show is like in Allentown.&nbsp Tickets were ten dollars, and we got two acts and two complementary drink stubs.&nbsp <em>My</em> DC-addled brain thought "They must be losing money on every ticket?"</p>
		<p>Obligatorily, i thought i saw my sixth-grade social studies teacher at the gig.&nbsp Obligatorily, there was a long-hair dude drunkenly yelling encouragement at the opener.&nbsp Local life.
		</p>
		<p>Any old punk could glean what i was getting into from the "Acid Dad" moniker, and they would have been right.&nbsp Maybe there is something vanilla about white dudes playing hard rock.&nbsp And i do wonder how anybody manages to stand out in such an oversaturated genre.&nbsp But i do find an expression of freedom in the wibble-wobble of the wah pedal over a mish-mash of high notes.&nbsp I probably could have made the same sounds, but i did not, so i guess i have to shut up and rock.

		<p>Wellll here we are.&nbsp Look at us.&nbsp Who would have thought?</p>
		<p>For our first show since the Before Times<sup>®</sup>, our friend tipped us off to a stacked bill at the Black Cat.&nbsp Thank goodness (Alhamdulillah, et cetera) that it still stands and still exists.&nbsp Troubled as i was to watch it shrink, the renovation is probably a better use of their space; it can maintain its core offerings while slimming its footprint on the pricey fourteenth street corridor.&nbsp Those core offerings are pinball, a noisy bar, and excellent, offbeat shows.</p>
		<p>Too Free, who i first experienced via their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R2DYl8AZhc">No Fun video</a>, are DC native disco proselytes, bringing heady and noisy grooves to the stage.&nbsp The programmed drums are easy to understand, easy to get behind.&nbsp Which leaves cognitive room for playful and nimble vocals.&nbsp Frankly, it was exactly the blend of humanity, noisebathing, and pulsation that the doctor ordered to cure your pandemic forgetting.</p>
		<p>When Exotiq Int'l took the stage, i remembered that shows could be very loud.&nbsp They are a new band, without any music <em>out</em>, as far as i can tell.&nbsp And they were working some kinks out onstage, but as professionals.&nbsp Jaguar from Priests fronts the band, Niko from bottled up whacks out highly-effected jazzy guitar chords, and Laura Harris from <a href=#ExHex>Ex Hex</a> maintains dance energy from the kit.&nbsp Dajando steals the show at times on the synthesizers with ripping fills that make your brain buffer and your eyelid twitch.&nbsp They are a band to keep in mind; there is a lot of potential energy there, and we could see it punctuate the show in flares.</p>

		<p>O is a garage rock album without all the froufrou.&nbsp It takes an as-needed approach to vocals while prioritizing wall-to-wall <em>riffs</em> and <em>fills</em>, tossing in approximately one and a half guitar solos.&nbsp This project blends the unpredictable noise of Gauntt's <a href="https://thomasgauntt.bandcamp.com/album/formant-void">experimental electronic percussive production</a> and Vanasse's blues-tinted post-punk guitar growls and wails into a punchy hard rocket launching to scratch a distant itch.&nbsp We recommend if you enjoy Lightning Bolt, Jack White, or Hella.</p>
		<p>O is a maximalist endeavor, offering no breaks for your ears, but a guaranteed sweaty energy level.&nbsp The mix comes off not as clean, but meticulous.&nbsp Lows shake the earth without muddying the water, while highs pierce the air near your skull.&nbsp Overall, the earfeel places you in the third to sixth row at a gig in a bar or basement.&nbsp Which works perfectly for a band so oriented to the live space (i have seen them play at least three times).&nbsp Even then, though, Gauntt puts up a wall of sound on turbo drums and Vanasse trips over an array of pedals to achieve blistering guitar tones.&nbsp Two men generate one unholy racket.&nbsp They could bring in more members, or play with fewer effects—but that would be too easy.</p>

		<p>I thought i watched Fat Tony walk on stage and light a huge blunt.&nbsp It turned out to be incense.&nbsp And he continued to surprise.&nbsp Fat Tony demonstrates what a solo artist can accomplish in the hip hop vein.&nbsp He had a heartfelt vegetarianism song, and shouted out to "All my creative types."&nbsp Is he corny?&nbsp <span class="whisper">Yes, a little.</span></p>
		<p>Tony's subby beats shake the club, he sings on key, and he raps; he is a triple threat!</p>
		<p>black midi's disjointed and tight sound recalls Primus, Swans, and David Bowie's Blackstar.&nbsp All the stops, starts, waves, and math can exhaust you.&nbsp But those <em>payoffs</em> make it worth it.&nbsp They look young.&nbsp i itch to read their biography, but that also may dispel the magic for me.&nbsp At one point i thought i heard them speak Dutch and thought "Are they European?&nbsp Could they be?".</p>
		<p>Our expansive domain of mosh cleared a circle during a buildup.&nbsp i thought somebody had gotten hurt.&nbsp Then the song dropped and we all leaped in.</p>
		<p>Were i a touring musician, i would want to surprise people with genre but you cannot do that because as a concertgoer you want to get the mood right.&nbsp And you could not ask the audience because the response would be "bglgheheib."&nbsp Everyone would want something different.&nbsp People want to know what they are getting into. &nbspAnd with black midi, you do.&nbsp But then, Fat Tony is a curveball.&nbsp So the show as a whole is for music lovers.</p>

		<p>Most of the time they held back and put the lyrics forward.&nbsp But when they stop sweetly harmonizing, their talent comes through.&nbsp Lally lays down cool grooves with tense intervals.&nbsp MacKaye still bends his little harmonic sounds; his detuned style carries over from the Fugazi days.&nbsp Farina pops unexpected rim-shots and fills fluidly.</p>

		<p>The Effects turn out to be a cool math rock band experimenting with unconventional rhythms and patterns.&nbsp We want to see them grip those odd meters with more courage.&nbsp But it is good to see a tight math rock band in the DC area, and <a href="https://www.dischord.com/band/the-effects">on Dischord</a>, no less.</p>
		<p>Tropical Fuckstorm shovels classic/arena rock voices and twisted guitars into a heaving, sweaty, emotive tide.&nbsp They kind of drag on, but less like a dying animal and more like a child shuffling their feet across the carpet, building up static.&nbsp Their competitive advantage is that they possess the ability to play tracks that <em>should</em> get boring and not just make them bearable, but dive through the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2010/08/bahamas-caves-underwater-blue-holes/">toxic clouds</a> and sample nutrient-rich sand beneath.&nbsp The Fuckstorm might exist outside genre, incorporating elements of ambient in their guitar noise and hip hop in their drums.&nbsp Indeed, their choruses sound like high speed drone.&nbsp 
		<p>I like to imagine that Fuckstorm is what we get when some scrappy Australians get together in a barn and just play music, not a genre.</p>

		<p>Between his husky vocals and imagist lyrics, Simon Joyner sounds like Lou Reed covering Bob Dylan.&nbsp <a href="https://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/2163/">Some</a> have pointed out a Leonard Cohen connection, but that was lost on me.
		As much as i have to chastise him for so prominently wearing his influences on his sleeve, i have to commend his creation of new sentences.&nbsp Morning Sun, Slow Down!  Like a children's song (for adults) Joyner tends to anthropomorphize aspects of nature like the seasons, body parts, or the sun.&nbsp His tenor voice is <em>present</em>.&nbsp It neither soars high nor dives low for long.&nbsp They say that people speak at Fa—the fourth on a major scale.&nbsp Joyner, for his part, navigates the path between singing and Uncle Simon storytime.</p>
		<p>Each instrument sounded necessary in its place.</p>
		<p>Pocket Moon, the title track from his forthcoming album, is a dark and lonesome cowboy desert song.</p>

		<p>Big Bill has supplied us with a steady drip of singles since 2017's <em>Toast</em>, so i was glad to receive all new tracks on this project.&nbsp Clocking thirteen minutes, it calls into question the public's attention span and the relevance of the album format.&nbsp But with interlude and outro, it makes a play in that direction.&nbsp <em>Gap Year</em> is a snapshot of a transitional period in someone's life.&nbsp It seeks to convey a few ideas cogently in a short time, and utilizes many hooks to that end.&nbsp There are no features and no added instrumentation on this project; it is a solitary venture.</p>
		<!--<em>Gap Year</em> represents a pivot from rapping to songwriting.</p>-->
		<p><em>Gap Year</em> often juxtaposes and conflates the mundane and profound.&nbsp Big Bill takes us from "I bought hella houseplants" to "Find my way" without interstice.&nbsp Details of everyday life serve as synechdoche for the cosmic struggles of man.</p>

		<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3NqV2DJoAWsjl787bWaHW7">Amyl and the Sniffers</a> delivered their mullet-clad fans a ripping punk show imbued with the fun, sexy confidence of cabaret.&nbsp Between songs, Amyl shadowboxed and flexed her biceps, Schwarzenegger style.&nbsp Watching her whip the air before the crowd with the mic's XLR cable, I had to wonder what their stage presence owes to the BDSM community.</p>
		<p>Between songs, Amyl bantered incomprehensibly in her twangy Outback yelps.</p>
		<p>Wrenching guitar riffs make the Sniffers notable; each track opened to waves of recognition and enthusiasm.&nbsp They did not play my favorite song, Gacked On Anger, though.&nbsp Or did they?&nbsp From the ecstatic, inexhaustible pit, Amyl's lyrics got hard to parse and all the riffs sounded vaguely familiar.</p>

		</p><p>Their multi-instrumentalism promises flexibility and potential.&nbsp Repetitive lyrics and repetitive licks, though, seem to subvert critics' longing for complexity.</p>

				<figcaption class="rightFigCaption">Tuttle teaching class</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>This was my first time attending a show at Pearl Street Warehouse.&nbsp Neck-length haircuts were profuse on the ladies at this show.&nbsp Unlike at rock or hip hop shows, Tuttle's banter made this feel relaxed and homely, as though we were at an impromptu jam in somebody's living room.&nbsp She took time to tell us a cute little story involving Jewel (a country artist whose popularity peaked at the turn of the century).</p>
		<p>Tuttle, at twenty-five, is immensely talented, yet unassuming.&nbsp She plays a mean clawhammer—a technique that looks like it combines the Wooten double slap and finger picking on alternating downward and upward strums.&nbsp When she started ripping out simultaneous bass lines and melodies at supersonic speeds, i could only shake my face around in ecstatic expression and exclaim "She is teaching <em>class</em>!"</p>
		<p>Tuttle covers a wide range of Americana genres: blues jams, bluegrass ditties, and alternative singer-songwriter.&nbsp She moves seamlessly from ballads to rippin' guitar solos.&nbsp Her bandmate, sliding on a Telecaster<sup>®</sup>, often expands the atmosphere of the overall sound.</p>
		<p>Tuttle's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1w0K4edsnTTxo2p6ZCErUV?si=TO_5i2FKSxarNuoXg4NlSg">new album</a> focuses more energy on songwriting and vocal performance.&nbsp Though i certainly prefer the bluegrass tracks on which she takes the lead on guitar, i trust her still to deliver well with her pure voice.</p>

				<figcaption class="leftFigCaption">Ex Hex rocking out</figcaption>

		<p>Ex Hex is glam rock.&nbsp You can tell because Wright plays a Gibson Flying V through Marshall stacks, because Harris slams the snare, and because all three are absolutely <em>glamorous</em>.&nbsp (Timony plays a <a href="https://www.kollguitars.com/news/2019/1/4/exhex">Koll</a>.)&nbsp And they shred.&nbsp It all feels good, like hearing "The Boys Are Back In Town."</p>
		<p>It is so vintage.</p>
		<p>A stripped-down sound that allows guitar riffs to speak for themselves updates the sound for the twenty-teens.&nbsp Their melodies seldom strayed far from the root; we take joy in simplicity.</p>
		<p>The crowd was predominantly women.&nbsp And the 9:30 club was nearly packed.&nbsp Ex Hex's grooves held us persistently on the precipice over mosh.</p>
		<p>This was my first time seeing The Messthetics live, and i like them.&nbsp And thanks to a 9:30 employee, i snagged Canty's drumstick after the show.</p>

		<p>Duendita groans like an eighteenth century galleon.&nbsp She roars like a tiger.&nbsp She makes her home in the low low (<a href="https://youtu.be/Edr2FI6b3yI?t=18">She's a bass!</a>), but assures you that she can hit the silky high notes when her voice pops up like a periscope out of water.</p>
		<p>Her delivery overall, like a boxer, is confrontational.&nbsp The rumble and tumble of SP-404 percussion keeps you off-kilter.&nbsp Vocal uppercuts soften you, and sly beat drops knock you over.&nbsp But she is equally respectful.&nbsp The way she laughs between songs, you could begin to believe that perhaps she is your <em>friend</em>.</p>
		<p>MorMor is touring with a full band, and it feels like a bit of a jam.&nbsp Few bands escape their individuals' stylistic aspirations.&nbsp The drummer smacked the snare with a street-funk sensibility while the other two leaned in and out of the mix.&nbsp This show was really a team effort: most members pulled double-duty (or mor) on instruments.&nbsp They had some sweet solos on the keyboard and guitar.&nbsp Mr. Mor has assembled a talented band here and i am excited to see where the new material goes with a band in mind.</p>
		<p>I could see the setlist from where i stood, which is, like, helpful, but ruins some of the fun.</p>
		<p>MorMor takes the side of Al Green and Gallant in the great debate over falsetto in rhythm and blues.&nbsp His voice, like that of an exotic bird, pierces through the lush foliage of augmented chords.&nbsp We are not sure where that bird came from, but i hope it goes far.</p>
		<p>MorMor closed his set with Heaven's Only Wishful.&nbsp I pulled my earplugs out to let it pass through my skull.&nbsp Shivers shaking my spine confirmed that i was in the place to which music sometimes takes you.</p>

		<p>Buke and Gase's inscrutable percussion constructs are sometimes chonk chonky, sometimes nimble.&nbsp We are never quite ready for those thunks.&nbsp Over these Aron pours his throbbing Gase lines.&nbsp Arone's Buke and voice create soaring walls of dissonance that scintillate like Archimedes' mirror ray of destruction.</p>
		<p>You look at the homemade instruments and hear the vocal yodel, and at times it seems that Buke and Gase owe something to folk music.&nbsp Are they singing the mountain songs of the chaotic urbane?&nbsp Is this the sound of the collective cranium buzz that pervades our modern society?&nbsp Merely to be awash in such cacophony feels rebellious.&nbsp Surely this will repel the administration, or your parents, or your boss, or whoever.</p>

				<figcaption class="rightFigCaption">Ivanka vacuums</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>The first thing i thought was "Wow, this vacuum is actually really annoying."  I walked into the exhibit and met a feeling of overwhelming anxiety.&nbsp I could not quite put my finger on the voyeuristic power dynamic setting me off-kilter but i knew that <em>This is like, weird, man</em>.&nbsp I felt like i was standing in the execution theater, and it made me really nervous.&nbsp It made me furrow my brow.</p>
		<p>Some tactile investigation revealed that the inviting pile of schmutz consisted of dry breadcrumbs.&nbsp Breadcrumbs?&nbsp Breadcrumbs leave a trail...&nbsp Aha!&nbsp These are Mueller's breadcrumbs, made from corruption croutons.&nbsp i have a thing for the Sisyphus story and Tibetan Buddhist sand art, so i sprinkled some breadcrumbs in a spot right after the Ivanka double vacuumed it.&nbsp i hope she is having insights about impermanence.&nbsp For my second toss, i tried to throw some to the back, to mix things up, but they only scattered widely.&nbsp Crumbs are not particularly aerodynamic.&nbsp i decided to rest on my laurels and stop at two tosses.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, this piece accomplishes what it sets out to do.&nbsp Nothing is more fragile than the image of somebody who has traded in their soul for a brand—that is, to become a brand.&nbsp You might undermine her integrity with fine points on cable news, but good heavens, do not expose the Brand!&nbsp The Brand is her livelihood.&nbsp The Brand is unique.&nbsp The Brand withers in ultraviolet light.</p>
		<p>Fake Ivanka's eyes would occasionally flit up and meet mine.&nbsp Is this part of the role of Ivanka?&nbsp Or is this a betrayal of the piece?&nbsp <i>Why is she doing that?&nbsp I think she really likes you, man.&nbsp Find her after the performance and ask her, "So how do you spend the other 22 hours of the day?"</i>&nbsp I wonder if she ever uses the detachable hose extension.&nbsp Nobody is supposed to vacuum in high heels.&nbsp Is she okay?&nbsp Hmm.&nbsp Blink twice if you need help, Ivanka double.</p>
		<p>But then, i suppose the real Ivanka did the piece a huge favor by tweeting about it.&nbsp Maybe that is her subtle congratulations, her blessing.&nbsp The vacuum sounds louder now.&nbsp I want to stay and fight to understand, but not at the expense of my night, nor my sanity.&nbsp I look away, i walk on home.&nbsp I leave Ivanka to her devices.</p>

		<h2 id="poppy">Poppy at 9:30 Club</h2>
		<h3>31/1/19</h3>
		<p>Okay so.&nbsp This is my second time seeing Poppy play live.&nbsp Since the Poppy.Computer tour, they have reinvented themselves as a sort of black metal princess force for uncertainty.&nbsp Madonna comparisons used to be apt; now she is more like Marilyn Manson.</p>
		<p>She was clearly not lip-syncing this time, which i like.&nbsp This was evident in her struggles to hit the high notes on Pop Music.&nbsp She also battled with Play Destroy's piped-in Grimes vocals—the bar trading and refrains are simply too rapid.&nbsp Poppy debuted on stage actually playing a <a href="https://dangelicoguitars.com/guitars/premier-series/premier-ss/#DAPSSOTCTCB">pale blue D'angelico</a>.&nbsp A pair of Marshall stacks flanked the center of the stage, a powerful device to anchor the show in rock and metal tradition.&nbsp Certainly, the addition of live instrumentation helps bring the show out of the interweb and into the physical realm.</p>
		<p>They played a lot of old tracks, even taking it back to Everybody Wants To Be Poppy, the first single she released as That Poppy.&nbsp Still no Lowlife, though.</p>
		<p>Their costumes appeared rather scruffy; I would think they could at least find better wigs.&nbsp But i suppose they blew the budget on their eight- by twenty-foot light-emitting diode display and Marshall stacks.</p>
		<p>This was a predominantly male audience.&nbsp i find difficulty decoding the psychology of that.&nbsp Poppy really needs to do something that makes me feel less concerned for her safety.&nbsp Maybe her staking out of a posture as a non-binary feminist flag-bearer will help balance the fanbase.&nbsp (The above observation is only my impression and this might vary between cities).</p>
		<p>Poppy, Titanic Sinclair, and team have an undeniable knack for creating earworms.&nbsp But i fear that the creative turns they took on <em>Am I A Girl?</em> will derail their satirical mimesis of pop music and multi-storied satire of creative influencer/superfan culture.&nbsp Moreover, though, this looks and sounds like the music they enjoy making.&nbsp I want them to be happy more than i want them to have an exhibit in the MoMA.</p>

				<figcaption class="leftFigCaption">Mdou Moctar</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>Some have suggested that the Sahara-Sahel regional folk-rock genre faces oversaturation.&nbsp Can Ali Farka Tourè, Toumani Diabaté, Fatoumata Diawara, Tinariwen, Rokia Traore, Songhoy Blues, Imarhan, Noura Mint Seymali, and other North African musicians with international acclaim make room for more to follow in their footsteps?&nbsp At least some of the appeal of Kel Tamashek and Desert Groove is its relative inscrutability to Western ears.&nbsp It could, conceivably, mainstream itself out of novelty.&nbsp Consider, alternatively, that these styles have transcended the critical mass of extremely online obscurantists and landed a genuine fandom in the world.&nbsp Congratulations, then, to the transnational Berber irregular polygon region on promulgating an uncompromising cultural export the way Jamaica has done with reggae and Mongolia has done with Tuvan throat singing.</p>
		<p>Mdou Moctar, for his part, showed signs of innovation.&nbsp These desert groove artists are always playing a balancing act between their open adoration of Jimi Hendrix and the traditions of their upbringing.&nbsp Some may feel inclined to say "...&nbsp but Moctar never strays far from his roots."  But he does stray; Moctar jams in recognizable ways.&nbsp He personally looks up to Eddie Van Halen, and that comes through in his playing.&nbsp Melodically, he does not seem far off from acceptable norms in Western music.&nbsp Probably because he grew up listening to classic rock.&nbsp My companion leaned over and made the	observation that they sounded like Kansas.&nbsp The band.&nbsp We all find what we look for, i suppose.&nbsp Moctar's shredded riffs, fed through a tube scream, scorch over his rhythm players, who ground the performance in tradition.&nbsp They took a linear route quite simple at its heart.</p>
		<p>In Desert Groove, and in Moctar's live performances, the groove follows the kick drum.&nbsp The snare offers syncopation.&nbsp But i saw at least one baby boomer clapping with the snare (the three and the three-and?).&nbsp Oh and the drummer sped up on numerous occasions, so he either needed a click track or this was an intentional effect to add to the sound's frenetic charge.</p>
		<p>It sounded downright nasty.</p>
		<p>Nasty?</p>
		<p>Yeah, you know, like when you see guitarists screwing up their faces during a solo, or funk band leaders leaning nearly all the way over?&nbsp Nasty.&nbsp They were playing nasty.&nbsp Together with the rushing rhythm section, the performance evoked a Youtube video entitled Nasty But Every Time It Gets Nasty It Gets Even Nastier.</p>

		<h2 id="TC">TC Superstar, Palette, and Model Homes at ~dwell~</h2>
		<h3>2/11/18</h3>
		<p>dwell possessed an extra-dank aroma today, which was noticeable from the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp Summitting the stairs, i noted that drying cannabis buds would provide tonight's backdrop.</p>
		<p>Model Homes played.</p>
		<p>But when TC Superstar pressed play on their SP, the space lit up.&nbsp TC Superstar used energy beam in a most positive manner, and it was super-effective.&nbsp We had even pulled the tire swing out of the way.&nbsp i do not care how important you think your job is.&nbsp You need to dance to this band.</p>
		<p>TC Superstar's lyrics treat the bleakness of the mundane with a bright glibness that disarms their heavy subtext.&nbsp Unfortunately, songs began to blend and blur together sonically, but that could indicate a cohesive album and artistic vision.&nbsp It was a good sound anyway, so please reprise it.&nbsp And the project spills out of the confines of sound into physical art and stage performance.&nbsp TC Superstar exudes something that says "art 
		installation" at least as much as "rock band."</p>
		<p>Their standout track used the chorus to hop along a reference to the Toyota Corolla.&nbsp (Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh.&nbsp The TC stands for Toyota Corollaaaa.&nbsp Okay.)</p>
		<p>Emily and Yuriko, dancers, toed the line between technical prowess and inviting people to ecstatic expressive freedom.&nbsp At least one amateur dancer in the room marveled at their balance, stamina, and flexibility.&nbsp We also send props to Connor for sounding good while dancing without lip-syncing, but more importantly, for wearing a WRGW tee.</p>
		<p>Palette tied together the night with their subterranean spaced out vocal frenzy.</p>
		<p>i had fun.&nbsp i feel good.&nbsp i feel warm.</p>

		<h3>19/10/18</h3>
		<p>dwell is a DIY venue in the Trinidad neighborhood of DC whose exact location is privileged information.&nbsp Zula's show there felt cozy and warm and nice.&nbsp This despite their being from Brooklyn.&nbsp Maybe i should not be so surprised that a DIY band felt at home in a DIY space.</p>
		<p>Zula takes influence from many artists, but tries not to wear them on their sleeves.&nbsp But they had one phrase that would have fit snugly	on Talking Heads' <i>1977</i>.&nbsp Their new material seems a little more Neutral Milk Hotel, a little less Lonerism.&nbsp It is certainly more verbose than the work they performed at Above the Bayou back in 2015.</p>
		<p>It sounds like i have reservations about the direction they are taking.&nbsp That sounds right.&nbsp But Zula, in its new incarnation, retains the essence of Zula that make it fresh and enjoyable.&nbsp Keep surprising me, Zula.&nbsp And keep playing shows in DC.</p>

		<h3>15/10/18</h3>
		<p>Tsuhimamire entered my life on trivia night at the Songbyrd Café.&nbsp We slid into a fourth place finish while in the next room, people were milling about the way they do in rooms too small to pace—with their heads down looking all around but at nobody.&nbsp But the moment Tsushimamire let out their warm-up noise, a crowd got in formation.&nbsp i found myself perched on a step, which was uncomfortable; i longed for a pit.</p>
		<p>They made me wonder what punk rock filtered in to Japan from across the ocean.&nbsp Were Tsushimamire pulling Minor Threat EPs from the rack?&nbsp How old are they, exactly?&nbsp Were Tsushimamire pulling Minor Threat CDs from the shelf back in the day?&nbsp Maybe i am not giving Japan enough credit.&nbsp The land of the rising sun has a long and colorful music history of its own, so why would punk rock be an exception?&nbsp Tsushimamire, for their part, blurred the line between emulation and innovation.&nbsp Truthfully, they employed more of the latter.</p>
		<p>Tsushima's crunchy bass grooves kept every measure interesting.&nbsp When the bass line followed the guitar, it was never the product of lazy songwriting, but a calculated move to add weight to a phrase.</p>
		<p>Takagi's percussion was energetic and tireless.&nbsp Fills were subdued and sparse.&nbsp Rather, Tsushimamire's drum section contributes urgency and amperage with reliable thudding on the floor tom.&nbsp The crashes were screwed in really tight though, which i thought was weird.</p>
		<p>Kono affected her guitar leads with reverb that reminded me of basement jams.&nbsp Which is kind of how the whole thing feels.&nbsp Except that their jams do not wander aimlessly.&nbsp Every riff is that one tastiest of licks you get out of an hour's jam session.</p>
		<p>Their fast ones ripped and their slower ones chunked hard.&nbsp One guy asked me if they were Melt-Banana, which i suppose sort of fair, but not really.&nbsp I try to make everything a Powerpuff Girls thing, but face it, they are all Buttercup.</p>
