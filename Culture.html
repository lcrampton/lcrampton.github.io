		<h2>TC Superstar, Palette, and Model Homes at ~dwell~</h2>
		<h3>2/11/18</h3>
		<p>dwell possessed an extra-dank aroma today, which was noticeable from the bottom of the stairs.  Summitting the stairs, i noted that drying 
		cannabis buds would provide tonight's backdrop.</p>
		<p>Model Homes played.</p>
		<p>But when TC Superstar pressed play on their SP, the space lit up.  TC Superstar used energy beam in a most positive manner, and it was 
		super-effective.  We had even pulled the tire swing out of the way.  i do not care how important you think your job is.  You need to dance to this band.
		<p>TC Superstar's lyrics treat the bleakness of the mundane with a bright glibness that disarms their heavy subtext.  Unfortunately, songs began 
		to blend and blur together sonically, but that could indicate a cohesive album and artistic vision.  It was a good sound anyway, so please reprise 
		it.  And the project spills out of the confines of sound into physical art and stage performance.  TC Superstar exudes something that says "art 
		installation" at least as much as "rock band."
		<p>Their standout track used the chorus to hop along a reference to the Toyota Corolla. (Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  The TC stands for Toyota Corollaaaa.  Okay.)
		<p>Emily and Yuriko, dancers, toed the line between technical prowess and inviting people to ecstatic expressive freedom.  At least one amateur 
		dancer in the room 		marveled at their balance, stamina, and flexibility.  We also send props to Connor for sounding good while dancing without 
		lip-syncing, but more importantly, for wearing a WRGW tee.
		<p>Palette tied together the night with their subterranean spaced out vocal frenzy.
		<p>i had fun.  i feel good.  i feel warm.</p><br>

		<h2>Zula and Dove Lady at ~dwell~</h2>
		<h3>19/10/18</h3>
		<p>dwell is a DIY venue in the Trinidad neighborhood of DC whose exact location is privileged information.  Zula's show there felt cozy and warm 
		and nice.  This despite their being from Brooklyn.  Maybe i should not be so surprised that a DIY band felt at home in a DIY space.
		<p>Zula takes influence from many artists, but tries not to wear them on their sleeves.  But they had one phrase that would have fit snugly
		on Talking Heads' <em>1977</em>.  Their new material seems a little more Neutral Milk Hotel, a little less Lonerism.  It is certainly more 
		verbose than the work they performed at Above the Bayou back in 2015.
		<p>It sounds like i have reservations about the direction they are taking.  That sounds right.  But Zula, in its new incarnation, retains the 
		essence of Zula that make it fresh and enjoyable.  Keep surprising me, Zula.  And keep playing shows in DC.</p><br>

        <h2>Tsushimamire at the Songbyrd Café</h2>
		<h3>15/10/18</h3>
		<p>Tsuhimamire entered my life on trivia night at the Songbyrd Café.  We slid into a fourth place finish while in the next room, people were 
		milling about the way they do in rooms too small to pace—with their heads down looking all around but at nobody.  But the moment Tsushimamire 
		let out their warm-up noise, a crowd got in formation.  i found myself perched on a step, which was uncomfortable; i longed for a pit.<br>
	<p>They made me wonder what punk rock filtered in to Japan from across the ocean.  Were Tsushimamire pulling Minor Threat EPs from the rack?  How old are 
	they, exactly?  Were Tsushimamire pulling Minor Threat CDs from the shelf back in the day?  Maybe i am not giving Japan enough credit.  The land of the 
	rising sun has a long and colorful music history of its own, so why would punk rock be an exception?  Tsushimamire, for their part, blurred the line 
	between emulation and innovation.  Truthfully, they employed more of the latter.<br>
	<p>Tsushima's crunchy bass grooves kept every measure interesting.  When the bass line followed the guitar, it was never the product of lazy songwriting, 
	but a calculated move to add weight to a phrase.<br>
	<p>Takagi's percussion was energetic and tireless.  Fills were subdued and sparse.  Rather, Tsushimamire's drum section contributes urgency and amperage 
	with reliable thudding on the floor tom.  The crashes were screwed in really tight though, which i thought was weird.<br>
	<p>Kono affected her guitar leads with reverb that reminded me of basement jams.  Which is kind of how the whole thing feels.  Except that their jams do 
	not wander aimlessly.  Every riff is that one tastiest of licks you get out of an hour's jam session.<br>
	<p>Their fast ones ripped and their slower ones chunked hard.  One guy asked me if they were Melt-Banana, which i suppose is fair.  i try to make 
	everything a Powerpuff Girls thing, but face it, they were all Buttercup.</p>
