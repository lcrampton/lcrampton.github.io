		<h2>Results!</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Josh Shapiro and Austin Davis trounced Mastriano and Delrosso in the Pennsylvania gubernatorial race.</li>
				<li>John Fetterman won a seat in the United States Senate.</li>
				<li>Susan Wild won a third term in the House of Representatives, this time with the <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::b0a94d77-5d99-41c5-bc01-5859a6e1f3e6">addition of Carbon County </a>to her district.</li>
				<li>Nick Miller picked up a seat in the newly drawn fourteenth senate district for Democrats in the state senate.</li>
				<li>Jarrett Coleman, member of the Parkland School Board, won election in the sixteenth senate district, formerly longtime senator Pat Browne's domain.</li>
				<li>Mike Schlossberg won re-election in a new, less-Democratic, more suburban district including western Allentown and most of Upper Macungie Township.&nbsp Full disclosure: Schlossberg employed me during this general election.&nbsp I am proud that we outperformed the partisan lean of the district; we earned more than sixty percent of the vote in a fifty-six percent Democratic district.</li>
				<li>In Allentown's east, Josh Siegel, Democratic member of city council, won a newly-drawn seat in the PA House.</li>
				<li>In central and southern Allentown and Emmaus borough, Democrat Peter Schweyer won re-election.</li>
				<li>Joe Emrick, a Republican incumbent of Nazareth, held on to a seat in the PA House.&nbsp He won with a very slim margin against our friend Anna Thomas.</li>
				<li>In western Lehigh County, Ryan Mackenzie won unopposed a seat in the PA House.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>I did not talk much with Republicans at the polling place this time.&nbsp I knew i was in for a long day, and did not want to feel as exhausted as i did after the <a href="https://lcrampton.github.io/Messages/Primary2022.html">primaries</a>.&nbsp But one guy grunted "loser" at me in passing, and a few said some pointed "No thank you"s or something to that effect.&nbsp I think the civility of days gone by will not return for some decades.</p>
			<p>Josh Shapiro blew the election denier Mastriano out of the water, winning by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/results/pennsylvania/governor">almost fifteen points</a>.&nbsp This looks like a forceful repudiation of candidates who openly promise to meddle in elections.&nbsp But in the positive case, Shapiro is a solid candidate who campaigned well.&nbsp He has been an effective Attorney General with deep humanity.&nbsp And his rhetorical prowess has prompted presidential conjecture.&nbsp Indeed, his presence may have propelled the Democratic takeover of the state house.</p>
			<p>Maybe it is a little obvious to say that invigorating gubernatorial candidates propel downballot victories.&nbsp DeSantis is the Republican counterexample to Shapiro.&nbsp But Democrats have been over-focused on the top of the ballot for too long.&nbsp They have fallen in love with big personalities like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama while splitting tickets as deep into blue territory as New England.&nbsp Polarization is making that less palatable; as Romney-style Republicans become endangered and the likes of Chris Christie fall in line with Trump, i suspect ticket-splitters will become likewise rare.&nbsp But, additionally, as Democrats adopt more data-driven, consultant-style campaigns and seek to turn back the tide of gerrymandering, they are dipping more into state-level races.&nbsp This is good for several reasons.&nbsp For one, parties develop their bench of talent here.&nbsp Shapiro and Fetterman (and Obama) came from <em>somewhere</em>.&nbsp But more imminently, states offer an extra layer of protection against the worst of Republicans' minoritarian theocracy.&nbsp In Pennsylvania, the Democratic takeover of the state house means a sweeping consitutional amendment to ban abortion and restrict voting will die.&nbsp There is a lot more room for good governance now.</p>
