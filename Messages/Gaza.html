		<h2>preface</h2>
			<p>It is impossible to be comprehensive speaking about this conflict.&nbsp History is fractal, and history is unfolding.&nbsp There is no way to acknowledge every angle and every caveat.</p>
			<p>It is also likely impossible to proceed without apparent bias or subjectivity.&nbsp I find the actions of Israel atrocious and more concerning than those of Hamas at this point, and that would probably become evident as this piece unfolds.&nbsp But i have never been to the region, and remain open to learning more about this situation.</p>
			<p>With that said, these are the facts that most color my understanding of the conflict.</p>
		<h2>context</h2>
			<p>Gaza is about twice the size of Brooklyn or Washington, DC.&nbsp Over two point three million people live there, which is close to the population of Queens.&nbsp Its population is <a href="https://mapfight.xyz/map/gaza/">comparable</a> to that of Slovenia, fifty-six times its size, or Lesotho, eighty-four times its size.</p>
			<p>A major war has broken out in the Levant in every decade since the establishment of Israel.&nbsp The interstices have been characterized by occupation, blockade, and economic dispossession, including—at one point—a <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/attachments/jps-articles/1069.pdf">prohibition</a> (pages 65-66) on planting new citrus trees.</p>
		<h2>facts</h2>
			<p>Almost half of Gazans are minors.&nbsp That means that men of military age likely make up less than a quarter of the population there.&nbsp Women and teens are well capable of violence (and young men are capable of nonviolence), but this is helpful to remember when Israel characterizes casualties and collateral damage.</p>
			<p>Israel has destroyed <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-146">sixty percent</a> of the homes in Gaza since October seventh.</p>
			<p>Britain made promises it could not keep with the Balfour Declaration, quoted here in its entirety:
				<blockquote cite="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration">His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.</blockquote>
			<p>To read this in good faith is to come to the conclusion that Balfour and the British were declaring support for something <em>much</em> more limited than present-day Israel or even the borders established in 1948.&nbsp In any case, the land was not theirs to give at the time; it was part of the Ottoman Empire.&nbsp And can we even grant the British colonial project in Mandatory Palestine a legitimacy which could justify Zionist claims to the land?&nbsp What about the Palestinians who lived there the whole time?&nbsp Do they not deserve the same rights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points#Text">self-determination</a> granted to the Poles in the international order that emerged from the Treaty of Versailles?</p>
			<p>It is also interesting that at the time of the declaration, Zionism was a rather fringe idea, rejected by most of the Jewish diaspora.&nbsp The idea of a Jewish homeland happened to be a pet project of Lord Rothschild, as well as various antisemites throughout history.
			</p>
			<p>Israel is using unguided bombs in Gaza.&nbsp Guided munitions are more costly, and there may be ways to aim dumb bombs.&nbsp But Gaza is a densely populated area.&nbsp And many humanitarian organizations operate within it.&nbsp Israel itself talks about how Hamas embeds with civilians, uses human shields, et cetera.&nbsp It is hard to square that with ostensible remorse over civilian casualties or air-to-ground payloads that are half unguided.</p>
			<p>Israeli leadership have <a href="https://youtu.be/eU19t5heB-4?si=yhuxqi6ESarYugD2">stated</a> genocidal intentions out loud.&nbsp You may recall Netanyahu's rhetoric about Amalek.&nbsp It is most concerning coming from political and military leaders, though the sentiment permeates Israeli society.</p>
			<p>There are people on both sides—no more and no less.&nbsp Many expect the parties on either side to act and desire in accordance with abstract morality or international law, rather than pivot on human feelings like revenge, frustration, and desperation.&nbsp If peace is made contingent on angelic standards, the region will never know peace.&nbsp People, especially in aggregate, act perniciously in the best of circumstances; war and occupation necessarily shorten tempers, draw down patience, engender cynicism, et cetera.&nbsp That makes the displays of humanity all the more incredible.&nbsp Hamas has nearly every excuse to treat captives poorly, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F54VgbyUoI8&pp=ygUXaGFtYXMgcHJpc29uZXIgd2l0aCBkb2c%3D">treats</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/egabZZL7s4s">at least</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coOptDiwyrU&pp=ygUXaGFtYXMgcHJpc29uZXIgd2l0aCBkb2c%3D">some</a> of them well.</p>
