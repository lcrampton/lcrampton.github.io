        <h1>Massacres In Russian-Occupied Ukraine</h1>
			<p>Russian ground forces have evidently executed hundreds of Ukrainian civilians in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCh_lo2zd0I">Bucha</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAr-vlrRJqY">Borodyanka</a>, and <a href="https://liveuamap.com/en/2022/8-april-132-bodies-of-people-shot-dead-were-found-in-makariv">Makariv</a>, suburbs or towns west of Kyiv.&nbsp These are war crimes, and they are not supposed to happen under the purview of modern military forces.&nbsp Nevertheless, they follow a pattern that has been visible in the United States' last few major military engagements.</p>
		<h2>How do such things happen?</h2>
			<p>During the North Korean advance into South Korea in 1950, American divisions experienced attacks on their rear flanks, and suspected North Koreans of hiding among refugees.&nbsp In response, leadership commanded ground forces to consider all persons moving toward the American lines as hostile.&nbsp At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Gun_Ri_massacre">No Gun Ri</a>, American-led forces slaughtered hundreds of refugees fleeing North Korea and the battlefield after pinning them down under a bridge.&nbsp The killing went on for three days, and only ended when North Korean advances forced the Americans to withdraw from the area.</p>
			<p>In 1968, American forces approached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%E1%BB%B9_Lai_massacre">Mỹ Lai</a> in Vietnam, expecting to find a Viet Cong stronghold.&nbsp When they arrived, they found little evidence of militia activity, but killed hundreds of unarmed civilians, including elders and children.&nbsp Lieutenant Calley shot and repeatedly ordered members of his platoon to fire on unarmed civilians after corralling them into ditches or clearings.&nbsp Colin Powell, in an investigation of American forces' treatment of Vietnamese people, <a href="https://capl.army.mil/case-studies/wcs-single.php?id=76&title=my-lai-at-50">failed to find evidence</a> of war crimes and characterized the relationship between the two groups as "excellent".&nbsp Military court-martials acquitted every officer involved in the cover-up of the events at Mỹ Lai.&nbsp The military only charged fourteen soldiers involved in the killing, and only one ever faced trial.&nbsp Richard Nixon <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/drawing-justice-courtroom-illustrations/about-this-exhibition/federal-and-special-courts/only-one-officer-found-guilty-of-my-lai-attrocities/">commuted</a> Lieutenant Calley's life sentence to three and a half years of house arrest.</p>

			<p>In the case of <a href="https://documentaryheaven.com/ghosts-of-abu-ghraib/">Abu Ghraib</a>, multiple leaders ordered and encouraged the criminal and inhumane treatment of prisoners there.&nbsp The detainees included many innocent Iraqis, and many were held without formal charges.&nbsp A riot resulted in several dead, and unleashed in the guards a new level of resentment and distrust.&nbsp Donald Rumsfeld personally signed off on stress positions, sleep deprivation, and other depraved interrogation techniques, with handwritten comments that suggest tolerance for even harsher treatment.&nbsp He reassigned General Geoffrey Miller from Guantánamo Bay to Abu Ghraib, to recreate what he viewed as successes there.&nbsp Miller received decoration for his service.&nbsp Rumsfeld never faced consequences for his decisions regarding Abu Ghraib.</p>
			<p>These events seem to have two things broadly in common:
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Perceived Hostility: </strong>Occupying ground troops distrust local civilian populations.&nbsp They see them as part of hostile forces.&nbsp Or troops begin having trouble distinguishing between legitimate military targets and civilians.&nbsp This could be one of the potential drawbacks of unconventional guerilla warfare that utilizes untrained partisans as ad hoc militia.&nbsp Blending in with civilian populations offers obvious advantages to insurgent forces, but blurs the line between combatants and noncombatants in a way which the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwpzzAefx9M">laws of war</a> are not designed to handle.</li>
					<li><strong>Permissive Command: </strong>In some of the most pernicious cases, commanding officers order the atrocities themselves.&nbsp In these cases, only an outside or opposing force can extinguish the fire of brutality before it runs out of fuel.&nbsp In other cases, commanders implicitly condone savage behavior with subtext or culture.&nbsp This could manifest as declining to prosecute war criminals, or deliberate obfuscation of the rules of engagement.&nbsp In some cases, and this may be the most descriptive of the situation among Russian troops around Kyiv, the chain of command simply breaks down.&nbsp Officers unable to communicate with or control their subordinates will not be able to stop them from engaging in abhorrent actions, even when counterproductive to the broader mission.</li>
				</ol>

			<p>We do not want to argue that the United States commits more war crimes than Russia, or is normatively worse in its imperialism, or suggest a moral equivalence between nations.&nbsp War crimes undermine the United States' geopolitical strategy, and at least most foreign policy and military leaders understand that.&nbsp ISAF forces dealt with a tangle of rules of engagement and combatant status in Afghanistan every day, and abided by them on most operations.&nbsp That made both strategic and moral sense.</p>
			<p>Broadly, it seems that Russia cares less about international law.&nbsp This is not even Russia's first set of war crimes in recent years.&nbsp They <a href="https://youtu.be/rCi-2-Flcxk">systematically bombed hospitals</a> in Syria as recently as 2019.&nbsp The United Nations had explicitly included these locations on no-strike lists provided to Russian leaders.&nbsp That good faith now seems quite evidently misplaced.&nbsp In one sense, Putin, as a leader of a regional (not global) power, can benefit from undermining the power of international institutions and norms, because a world united against bad actors checks his ambitions more effectively than a fractured world of realist opportunists.&nbsp But this strategy quickly bifurcates; it only works if it works, and really does not work if it does not.</p>
			<p>Comparing this to relatively isolated incidents rather than systematic ethnic cleansing and genocides implies that this is an isolated incident, or misstep, and not part of a wider Russian campaign of forceful Russification.&nbsp But so far—and the situation evolves, making analyses obsolete every day—the instances of outright slaughter have been bounded within the suburbs around Kyiv.&nbsp We hope the findings of the last week are exhaustive and not pieces of a larger pattern.&nbsp As the truth unfurls and more evidence becomes available, we may need to swap out our historical lens for a more grave one.&nbsp Furthermore, it does not align with Russia's strategic objectives, either as stated or as widely understood.&nbsp We knew that Russia would seek to imitate the victories it wrought from <a href="https://lcrampton.github.io/Messages/Ukraine.html">Grozny-style subjugation</a>.&nbsp We knew not to underestimate their potential for brutality.&nbsp But this kind of premeditated killing will make occupation more difficult, will harden international opposition, and may offend otherwise ambivalent Russians and Ukrainian Russian-speakers.&nbsp If Putin or his lieutenants ordered or condoned these atrocities, or believed they would go unnoticed, then they resulted from yet another miscalculation.
