        <h1>Bucha</h1>
		<p>Russian ground forces have evidently executed hundreds of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, Borodyanka, and <a href="https://liveuamap.com/en/2022/8-april-132-bodies-of-people-shot-dead-were-found-in-makariv">Makariv</a>, suburbs or towns west of Kyiv.&nbsp These are war crimes, and they are not supposed to happen under the purview of modern military forces.</p>
		<h2>How do such things happen?</h2>
			<p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Gun_Ri_massacre">No Gun Ri</a> in Korea, American-led forces slaughtered hundreds of refugees fleeing North Korea and the battlefield after pinning them down under a bridge.&nbsp The killing went on for three days, and only ended when North Korean advances forced the Americans to withdraw from the area.</p>
			<p>At Mỹ Lai in Vietnam, American forces killed hundreds of unarmed civilians, including elders and children.</p>

			<p>In the case of Abu Ghraib, multiple leaders ordered and encouraged the criminal and inhumane treatment of prisoners there.&nbsp Donald Rumsfeld personally signed off on stress positions, sleep deprivation, and other depraved interrogation techniques, with handwritten comments that suggest tolerance for even harsher treatment.</p>
			<p>These events seem to have two things broadly in common:
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Perceived Hostility: </strong>Occupying ground troops distrust local civilian populations.&nbsp They see them as part of hostile forces.&nbsp Or troops begin having trouble distinguishing between legitimate military targets and civilians.&nbsp This could be one of the potential drawbacks of unconventional guerilla warfare that utilizes untrained partisans as ad hoc militia.&nbsp Blending in with civilian populations offers obvious advantages to insurgent forces, but blurs the line between combatants and noncombatants in a way which the laws of war are not designed to handle.</li>
					<li><strong>Permissive Command: </strong>Command condones or ignores breaches of the rules of engagement, or obfuscates the rules of engagement, or breaks down.&nbsp In the case of No Gun Ri, leadership commanded ground forces to consider all persons advancing south as hostile.&nbsp </li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>This is not even Russia's first set of war crimes.&nbsp They <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCi-2-Flcxk&t=311s">systematically bombed hospitals</a> in Syria.&nbsp The United States bombed a hospital in Afghanistan, under quite different circumstances.</p>
			<p>Comparing this to relatively isolated incidents rather than systematic ethnic cleansing and genocides implies that this is an isolated incident, or misstep, and not part of a wider Russian campaign of genocide.&nbsp But so far—and the situation evolves, making analyses obsolete every day—we have only seen one instance of such outright slaughter.&nbsp We hope the findings in Bucha and Borodyanka are exhaustive and not pieces of a larger pattern.&nbsp As the truth unfurls and more evidence becomes available, we may need to swap out our historical lens for a more grave one.&nbsp Furthermore, it does not align with Russia's strategic objectives, either as stated or as widely understood.&nbsp This kind of indiscriminate killing will make occupation more difficult, will harden international opposition, and may offend otherwise ambivalent Russians and Ukrainian Russian-speakers.&nbsp If Putin or his lieutenants ordered or condoned these atrocities, it represents yet another miscalculation.
