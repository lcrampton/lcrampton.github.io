		<h2>Results!</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Doug Mastriano won the Republican nomination to run for governor.&nbsp This man is <a href="https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-did-doug-mastriano-say">a liability</a> to free and fair elections in Pennsylvania.&nbsp He was present at the riot on January 6, 2021.</li>
				<li>John Fetterman handily secured the Democratic nomination for United States Senate, winning in every county.&nbsp Fetterman is a progressive with widespread appeal, and commands an excitement that we believe can bring more Democrats to the polls.</li>
				<li>The Republican nomination for United States Senate remains too close to call, between Mehmet Oz and David McCormick.&nbsp Oz knows nothing of how most people live.&nbsp David McCormick is more of a neoconservative, member of the World Economic Forum; he used to run the world's largest hedge fund.&nbsp We did not know what to make of this race, but listening to our Republican acquaintances, we thought that perhaps dark horse candidate Cathy Barnette would take it.</li>
				<li>Lisa Scheller beat Kevin Dellicker for the nomination to try to unseat Susan Wild in the 7th Congressional district.&nbsp Dellicker is more of an old-school Republican, who we have heard Democrats describe as something to the effect of "a decent guy."&nbsp Scheller's campaign manager, <a href="https://crohlv.noblogs.org/post/2021/01/12/steve-lynch/">Steven Lynch</a>, ran unsuccessfully for Northampton County executive, and is one of the conspiracists who rioted at the Capitol to decertify the 2020 election.</li>
				<li>In the race for the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania's fourteenth senate district, Nick Miller, vice president of the Allen School Board, <a href="https://armchairlehighvalley.substack.com/p/miller-claims-victory-in-close-14th?s=r">declared victory</a> with a forty-two-vote lead over Tara Zrinski, a county commissioner in Northampton County.&nbsp Tara has not conceded.&nbsp Disclosure: i worked for Nick Miller's campaign during this primary.</li>
				<li>Dean Browning secured the Republican nomination in the race for the fourteenth state senate district.&nbsp Dean Browning is that straight white guy who <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/11/10/21559458/dean-browning-dan-purdy-byl-holte-patti-labelle-twitter-gay-black-man">forgot to switch</a> to his alternate Twitter account before tweeting about how Obama never did anything for him as a gay black man.</li>
				<li>Jarrett Coleman, member of the Parkland School Board, <a href="https://armchairlehighvalley.substack.com/p/jarrett-coleman-emerges-on-top-of?s=w">declared victory</a> over seven-term incumbent Pat Browne.&nbsp Pat has not conceded.&nbsp The vote difference appears to be twenty-four votes.&nbsp Coleman is an anti-masker and "critical race theory" alarmist who overcame a coalition of school board candidates to win a seat on the board in November 2021.&nbsp The Republican nominee is highly likely to win this seat.</li>
				<li>In Allentown's east, Josh Siegel, member of city council, beat out Saeed Georges, a social case worker and volleyball coach for the democratic State Assembly nomination there.&nbsp Disclosure: i canvassed for Saeed's campaign on a few days during this primary.</li>
				<li>In central and southern Allentown and Emmaus borough, Peter Schweyer beat Enid Santiago for the Democratic nomination for the State Assembly seat there.&nbsp Disclosure: i worked for Peter's campaign during this primary.</li>
				<li>In western Lehigh County, Ryan Mackenzie won the Republican nomination for State Assembly over Gary Day.&nbsp Both men were incumbents, who ended up running against each other when this year's redistricting plotted the <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::12a18072-adf1-48ac-a9d1-12280567b824">187th district</a> around both of their residences.&nbsp They characterized this race with a tandem-run to the right of the political spectrum, and Mackenzie went furthest.</li>

		<h2>Talking to Republicans</h2>
			<p>We met Barbara, Frank, Chad, Joey, and Patty canvassing at the polling place.&nbsp A few things are clear from interviewing them.</p>
			<p>The belief that Democrats somehow sullied the 2020 election for their favor is not only widespread, but mainstream among Republicans.&nbsp Frank encouraged me to watch D'Souza's <i>2000 Mules</i>.&nbsp They seemed confident it would convince me of wrongdoing.&nbsp (The movie traces the paths of cellphones around cities past several ballot boxes, and reviews some footage of people dropping more than one ballot in a dropbox, or dropping a ballot with gloves on, or photographing the ballot box, and presents this as evidence of election tampering.&nbsp It never links the paths to individuals in the footage and never shows an individual dropping ballots in more than one box.&nbsp D'Souza remains an unimpressive douche canoe who makes bad faith arguments that Democrats are white supremacists and lazy arguments for the existence of God, and who did not deserve the pardon that Trump granted him.)</p>
			<p>The Republican Party of John McCain and Dwight Eisenhower no longer exists.&nbsp Frank named Brian Kemp, Brad Raffensberger, and George W. Bush as Republicans in name only (RINOs).&nbsp There is no more fair play or good faith.&nbsp They want officials who will protest, obstruct, and overturn undesirable election results.&nbsp They want officials who will throw the rulebook at opponents when convenient and throw it in the fire when expedient.&nbsp They want brutality and hegemony for their theocratic and parochial ideals.</p>
			<p>I spoke with Chad about fetal personhood.&nbsp I will admit that the one point he got me to pause was when i said that a fetus cannot form memories or anticipate pain, and he asked if it would be okay to kill a blackout-drunk person.&nbsp I realize why this tripped me up: it would be more merciful to kill a person while intoxicated than when sober and alert; everybody hopes to die in their sleep.&nbsp But it would still cause insurmountable distress for the people who count on and love that person.&nbsp At a societal level, a society that permits murder of highly-intoxicated people would descend into chaos, while a society that provides healthcare to women thrives.&nbsp He did, when i asserted that many women seek abortions when other forms of birth control fail, stoop to the level of slut-shaming, though he did it in an endearing way.</p>
			<p>These people do not think at the societal level.&nbsp Everything is conceptualized at the individual or family level.&nbsp Joey, a self-described anarchist who had wrapped the spare tire on her Jeep<sup>®</sup> with a cover that reads "Taxation is Theft," frustrated me with her virulent anti-vaccine sentiments.&nbsp She refused to see the benefits at the level of <em>public</em> health that justify many vaccination campaigns.&nbsp She got me to say "What the fuck?" when she asserted that the manufacturers of the Covid vaccines wrote in their applications for approval that the vaccines do not prevent Covid.</p>
			<p>Talking to these people was exhausting.&nbsp But the saving grace was that we were able to talk about other things.&nbsp Barbara knew a lot about trains, and Chad seemed to have worked on or around railroads.&nbsp Both Chad and Joey were into mushroom foraging.&nbsp I was able to walk away with a personal respect for most of these people.&nbsp My anger is reserved for disinformation networks, bad faith leaders, and <strong>motivated reasoning</strong>.
