				<div class="grid-item">1. The flour type should match the type of flour you intend to use for your bread.&nbsp The water should be as pure as possible.&nbsp I use tap water.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">2. Place flour in a container.&nbsp Glass is ideal.&nbsp Ceramic and plastic can work as well, though it may take on some flavor from certain plastics.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">3. Add slightly less than an equal volume of water to the flour.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">4. Stir or shake.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">5. Cover and allow to rest eight to twelve hours in a warm—not hot—space.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">6. Allow to rest in a cool space.&nbsp A refrigerator works fine; some would argue that the slower the starter grows, the deeper flavor it accrues.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">7. Regularly pour out excess moisture and feed the yeast with more flour.&nbsp Add water to maintain texture.&nbsp We find that a mixture with a higher viscosity tends to resist over-souring (rotting).</div>
