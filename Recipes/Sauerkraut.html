				"recipeInstructions": "You gotta have starter. Pour sourdough and 1 cup flour into large bowl. Heat water to warm but not piping hot, about 90-100°F. Dissolve sugar or molasses in water and stir gradually into flour mixture. Let rest fifteen to thirty minutes. Place  1 3/4 flour on counter.&nbsp Grind rosemary, salt, and coriander and add to flour. Excavate a divot into the flour, pour the starter mixture into the divot, and fold the dry flour into the wet mixture.&nbsp Mix and knead until a firm doughball retains its shape.	Allow to rest for two to three hours at room temperature.&nbsp You may also leave this overnight in the refrigerator and remove from the refrigerator two hours before working.	Divide dough into eight or ten parts and roll into balls.&nbsp Let rest for fifteen to thirty minutes. Smack, roll out, stretch, and shape doughballs into a disk and pan-fry in EVOO on medium-high heat until golden brown.",

				<div class="grid-item">1/4 cup kosher salt</div>
				<div class="grid-item">1 cup water</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="directions">
				<div class="grid-item">1. Divide the cabbage head into four quarters and remove the stalk.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">2. Thinly slice the cabbage lengthwise, along the grain.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">3. Place slices in a large bowl, layering them with the salt.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">4. Macerate the sliced cabbage, beginning with short massaging strokes, then graduating to squeezing grips and rolling fists.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">5. Transfer cabbage to its fermentation container.&nbsp Ideally, this would be an airtight jar or fermentation crock.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">6. We want to extract enough liquid from the cabbage to cover it.&nbsp Not every cabbage head contains enough liquid to achieve this.&nbsp If you find yourself in that position, use water (ideally distilled, but i use tap water) to cover.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">7. Use a flat item and a heavy item to keep the cabbage below the water surface.&nbsp Seal the lid.</div>
				<div class="grid-item">8. Allow to ferment for two to three weeks.</div>
